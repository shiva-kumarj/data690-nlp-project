0,Are electric cars really better for the environment?,"Electric vehicles, you might have heard, have a mineral problem. Beneath the floor of an EV sits a900-pound batteryfilled with minerals extracted from around the world. Millions of tons of lithium, cobalt, bauxite and other minerals are mined, processed, shipped and refined — sometimes leaving atrail of human rights and environmental abuses. For some, that makes fossil fuel engines look good by comparison. No one wants to drive around on thecobalt equivalent of blood diamonds. But does all this mining negate the climate and environmental benefits of EVs compared to sticking with gas? I looked into the world’s evolving supply chains for the clean-energy economy. In every scenario, it turns out, the demand for battery minerals represents a tiny fraction of the amounts of fossil fuels now needed to power the world. But not everything is measured in tons. For EVs to fulfill their clean-energy promise, they need to avoid repeating the mistakes of the first Industrial Revolution. Miners and manufacturers can embrace cleaner ways to get the materials they need, and recover more of what they use. Here’s how EVs and gasoline cars stack up. Almost all cars require steel, aluminum, copper, plastic, rubber and glass. Where EVs differ most from conventional vehicles is in their battery packs. Atypical 200-mile range EVlugs around a lithium-ion battery pack that’s nearly a third of the weight of the vehicle. Much of that weight is the battery pack’s casing, structural materials and aliquid electrolytethat ferries electrons around to charge and discharge the battery. But roughly 353 pounds are crucial minerals or metals, including cobalt, nickel, manganese, graphite, aluminum and copper,estimates Transport and Environment, a nongovernmental organization campaigning for cleaner transport. Not counting steel and aluminum, says MIT, anEV requires six times more minerals than a conventional vehicle. We will need a massive increase in these materials in the coming years. Global EV sales are predicted to surpass gas-vehicle sales in just over a decade after havingblown past early projections.General Motors, Volkswagen, Volvo, Hyundai and Hondacommitted to electrifying their lineup. With jurisdictions from California to theEuropean Unionprohibiting the sale of most new fossil fuel vehiclesby 2035, thevast majority of new passenger vehiclesare likely to be electric well before mid-century. That will mean expanding today’s mines and launching new ones. “The volume is large and it’s going to get very large,” says Gerbrand Ceder, a professor of materials science at the University of California at Berkeley. Gigafactories springing up around the world to build batteries are already straining the volume of clean-energy minerals the mining industry can produce. Mining minerals is never a clean affair. Cobalt from Congo, lithium and graphite from China, nickel from Indonesia and Russia, and battery supply chains thatrun through Xinjiang, in the Uyghur regionwhere forced labor has been rampant: All of these have immediate problems, which The Washington Post explored in our “Clean Cars, Hidden Toll” series. Guinea, home to the world’s largest bauxite reserves for aluminum,yields misery for local communities. Nickel refiners in Indonesia areadopting a risky technology. Mineworkers in South Africa, the world’s largest producer of manganese,face neurological ills. These environmental and social problems are real. But compared to the track record of the oil, gas and coal industry, they are a drop in the barrel. To compare EVs with conventional vehicles, first we need to look at how much stuff we pull out of the ground tomake and fuel them. Mining minerals for the clean-energy economy is measured in millions of tons per year. For fossil fuel extraction, that’s a rounding error. In 2020, building the world’s wind turbines, solar panels, EVs and other clean-energy infrastructure demanded 7 million tons of minerals,estimates the International Energy Agency. Roughly half of this was destined for batteries and EVs. The oil, gas and coal industry, by contrast, extracted the equivalent of15 billion metric tonsin 2019. And the industry will need to extract it year after year to keep supplying energy. Clean-energy technology can use these materials for decades or, if recycled, in perpetuity. “That’s a point we’ve been trying to make for a long time,” says Kwasi Ampofo, the head of metals and mining at BloombergNEF,aclean-energy research groupin London. “Even on a volumetric basis, it’s important to highlight the fact that fossil fuels are not comparable.” That remains true even if EVs and batteries were part of a massive, global transition to clean energy. In a scenario limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, the IEA estimates the amount of critical minerals needed would be roughly 500 times less in terms of volume than today’s fossil fuel extraction. Of course, material mined isn’t a perfect gauge of environmental damage. Local environmental effects tend to scale with the amount of stuff we pull out of theground. Extracting 1 ton of copper, for example, requires digging uparound 100 tons of ore. But even accounting for this, estimates Sam Calisch, a scientist at the nonprofit Rewiring America,mining minerals for the clean-energy economy amounts to extracting about five times less matter than what’s extracted by the fossil fuel industry. “This is still massive,” Calisch says. EVs already emitless than a thirdof the emissions per mile than their gasoline counterparts, on average, if you’re plugging into America’s electricity mix. But what if you account for emissions from mining metals, manufacturing, refueling and disposal of EVs? Noah Horesh, a researcher at Colorado State University who studies life cycle emissions in the transportation sector, has analyzed vehicles’ emissions over their life spans. Horesh estimates fossil fuel vehicles generate roughly twice the emissions of an EV, even accounting for emissions from extracting added minerals and metals. This difference will only grow as the electricity sectordecarbonizes, and battery manufacturingbecomes far more efficient. People recharging with clean electricity, or driving smaller vehicles, may already see a bigger difference today. Air pollution, one of theworld’s leading killers, will decrease as well. Fossil fuels are responsible for 4 million to8 millionexcess deathseach year tied to air pollution, reportstudies in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academies of ScienceandEnvironmental Research. Cleaning up the mineral supply chain for batteries, unlike the oil industry, remains a distinct possibility. The Inflation Reduction Act incentivizes automakers to use mineral supply chains in the United States or countries with close trade relations. Mining companies are being pushed, or forced, to clean up their act as buyers, automakers and countries demand more transparent supply chains. New technology is also reducing negative impacts. None of this is guaranteed.Lead the Charge, an advocacy network tracking the supply chains of the world’s leading automakers, says many are making progress on their efforts to eliminate emissions, environmental harms and human rights violations. “But as an industry,” it says, “there is a long way to go.” You cansee their leader board of automakers here. Still, we’re starting to see some changes. Researchers and battery makers are racing to replace nickel and cobalt with metals such as manganese and iron that are safer, abundant, nontoxic and cheap. “There are only a few metals at the intersection of what we can use and what we produce a lot of,” says Ceder. “But we’re seeing significant progress in that area.” Manufacturers now usesix times less cobaltin EV batteries, or have eliminated it entirely in recent years. Last year, half of the vehicles Tesla sold in the first quartercontained batteries with no cobalt or nickel. Recycling already holds great promise. Today,only about 5 percent of lithium-ion batteriesacross all products are recycled in the U.S. Within a few decades, accordingto the nonprofit International Council on Clean Transportation, the vast majority of EV batteries will likely be collected and repurposed for a second life such as grid energy storage, or recycled, cutting the EV demand for minerals by about a third. Lead-acid car batteries provide a model: an estimated 99 percent are recycled. That has created a nearly closed loop for reusing lead, report researchers inthe peer-reviewed journal American Economic Review: Insights. “The transition to low-carbon fuels is not a magic bullet with no negative outcome,"" says Sergey Paltsev, a senior research scientist at MIT. “There is no free lunch. But it’s much less harmful than if we stay with fossil fuels. That’s the conclusion.”",washington-post,east-coast,electric vehicles might heard mineral problem beneath floor ev sits a900pound batteryfilled minerals extracted around world millions tons lithium

1,Electric Vehicles Alone Can’t Solve Climate Change,"Arresting climate change requires, among other things, the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. But managing the transition from gas-powered cars won’t be easy. President Joe Biden’s administration has proposed new rules to sharply limit tailpipe emissions, with the aim of compelling automakers to devote at least two-thirds of new sales to EVs within the next decade. For this policy to work, the government will have to get a lot of other things right. The logic behind the plan is straightforward: To eliminate carbon emissions by 2050, the US needs to slash pollution from cars and trucks. Getting more electric vehicles on the road will help. But without supporting policies, EVs are unlikely to cut carbon emissions as much as advocates envision. Policymakers owe the public an honest accounting of costs and benefits. Worldwide, EVs account for 13% of new car sales, up from 0.2% a decade ago. Their market share in the US has nearly doubled over the last year, to 5.8%, thanks in part to federal tax credits of $7,500 included in the Inflation Reduction Act. Biden’s new regulations aim to accelerate the transition, by lowering the cap on carbon emissions for new vehicles by 56% between 2026 and 2032. For automakers to meet the tougher standards, 67% of their sales would have to come from zero-emission EVs. The administration projects that this will reduce the US’s carbon footprint by 7.3 billion tons by 2055, the equivalent of eliminating four years’ worth of transportation-related emissions. Such goals are laudable, but as things stand it’s doubtful that the US can achieve them. Generous subsidies have juiced demand for EVs, but maintaining them will be costly. The average price of a new EV is still $12,000 higher than that of a gas guzzler. Experts project that it may reach parity as early as this year, but even then, Americans are unlikely to abandon their gas-powered cars if the battery-charging infrastructure remains inadequate. Note too that EV buyers don’t typically stop driving their other cars: Current EV owners have an average of 2.7 vehicles, compared to 2.1 among all households, and two-thirds use their gas-powered vehicles more often. Other factors will also complicate the transition. The auto industry’s rapid shift to EVs at the expense of new and more efficient gas-powered models might cause some consumers to keep driving dirtier vehicles longer than they otherwise would. Electric vehicles also create carbon footprints of their own, once one accounts for the mineral extraction needed to assemble their batteries and the electricity needed to power them. That’s to say nothing of the supply-chain challenges: At the moment, production of numerous vital components is largely controlled by China. EV uptake should certainly be encouraged — but alongside measures to mitigate these challenges and guard against unintended consequences. Policymakers need to speed the buildout of charging stations and promote domestic extraction of critical minerals. No less important, cheaper fuel-efficient alternatives and rival zero-emission technologies should be allowed to compete with EVs on level terms. Ideally, an economy-wide tax on carbon emissions should be part of the mix. This would raise the price of gasoline and encourage consumers to buy clean-energy cars (regardless of the technology used) while driving their older, dirtier models less. Crucially, it would also promote energy efficiency more broadly and accelerate efforts to decarbonize the supply of electricity. Granted, building political support in the US for a carbon tax is challenging. Until that changes, the government can still incentivize low-carbon transportation more effectively — by extending tax credits to gas-powered hybrids and imposing congestion charges on high-polluting cars in urban areas, for example. Fighting climate change requires a comprehensive and coherent strategy. EVs are part of the answer, but only part. Much hard work remains to be done.

2,Buy an electric vehicle now or wait? Here’s how to decide.,"Thecoronaviruspandemic saw a virtually unprecedented spike in the price of vehicles. As chip shortages hobbled the industry, automakers rationed semiconductors, installing them mainly in their most profitable, and most expensive, models. Millions of affordable vehicles, the ones accessible to most new car buyers,never got built. That drove up the median price of new vehicles in the United States from around $38,000 before the pandemic to a record$49,000 or so this February, according to Cox Automotive. With electric vehicles, the pain was even more acute — if you could find one. In February, the average EV price soared to more than $58,000,accordingto Kelley Blue Book, roughly theannual income of the median U.S. worker.Dealers have been able to charge well over the sticker price as buyers have lost the ability to negotiate. “If someone hasn’t been in the market, they’ll be really shocked by how much a vehicle costs,” says Mark Wakefield, an automotive specialist at the global consulting firm AlixPartners. The limited supply of EVs is colliding with unexpected demand. Despite inventories at a fraction of their pre-pandemic levels, EV sales are outperforming even the more optimistic projections of a few years ago. In January 2022, EVs represented just4.3 percent of new sales. This January, the share was more than 7 percent. “EVs are still hot enough they’re essentially sold out for the rest of the year,” says Ivan Drury, who analyzes the automotive market for Edmunds. But even with vehicle prices near record highs, better deals may soon be at hand. Tesla isslashing prices, prompting the rest of the EV industry to follow suit. New federal tax subsidies are coming online, though which vehicles qualify is a moving target. And automakers are releasing a fleet of new all-electric models over the coming months. What’s a prospective EV buyer to do: Buy now or wait? There’s no right answer, but the decision boils down to a few other questions: How much can you spend? What type of vehicle do you need? Do you (or your EV) qualify for federal incentives? Would you buy used or lease? Here are the key questions for an EV shopper. Yes, slowly. EVs remain well above the industry average,reportsKelley Blue Book, but prices have been on a steady decline since the beginning of the year. The new federal incentives could lower them even more. Tesla started reducing prices to guard its dominant market as some federal incentives for Tesla’s EVs are phased out undernew rules on April 18. Since January, Tesla has cut the prices of its base Model 3 and Model Y by11 percent and 20 percent, respectively. Tesla still controlsmore than halfof the EV market in the United States, and other automakers have followed its lead. The average price paid for a new EV in February fell by 1.8 percent, or $1,050, over the previous month,reports Kelley Blue Book. Another factor is more models hitting showrooms.Dozens of new all-electric modelsare expected to debut in the next two years, expanding the EV selection beyond today’s concentration in sedans and small crossovers and SUVs. Rivals could start lowering prices more as competition heats up. When it comes to electric vehicles, your options are large, affordable or long range. “You can pick two,” says David Undercoffler of Autolist, an online car shopping platform. Small sedans and hatchbacks like the Model 3, Model Y, Chevy Bolt and Nissan Leaf have been the mainstays of the market. The Bolt starts at$26,500. Recently, automakers have focused on selling somewhat compact SUVs and crossovers with ranges of about 250 miles. That includes the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Tesla Model Y, Kia Niro EV and Volkswagen ID.4. “If that’s the size vehicle they’re looking for, go for it,” says Undercoffler. “But for a middle-class family looking for a large, affordable, family, electric SUV, there’s really nothing there yet.” Selection is scarce across the board, especially for larger vehicles popular in the United States.  If you want a truck, Rivian might be able to deliver its$80,000 flagship modelin a matter of months. If you want the Ford F-150 Lightning, delivery could take as long asthree years. Expect automakers like Kia and Hyundai, both with breakout electric successes, to expand options at the lower end of the market. Toyota, after resisting all-electric models, finally released thebZ4Xlast year. And there is a distant prospect of inexpensive, made-in-China EVs arriving in the United States. China’s electric automakers are eager to enter the U.S. market just as Toyota, Hyundai and other Asian automakers did decades ago selling small, low-cost vehicles. In 2021, Toyotabumped GMas the top-selling automaker in the United States. For now, the only Chinese automaker to sell lots of cars in the United States is the Zhejiang Geely Holding Group after buying the Swedish automaker Volvo in 2010. Chinese companies face stiff economic head winds given punishing U.S. tariffs. Past attempts by Chinese automakers to avoid tariffs bybuilding vehicles in South Koreahaveled to bankruptcy. As relations with China deteriorate, don’t hold your breath for inexpensive Chinese EV imports. New purpose-built electric vehicles are now arriving. Early electric models were gasoline models with engines ripped out and replaced with electric motors tocomply with California’s strict clean-air regulations. These “compliance cars” were produced in small numbers with little exciting technology or marketing to attract buyers. “Today’s vehicles are so different,” says Drury at Edmunds. “It’s not the same vehicle anymore.” New electric vehicles not only offersuperior performance,but promise lower prices than conventional vehicles once global manufacturers ramp up production backed by more thanhalf a trillion dollarsin new investment. But no one I spoke to thought that huge technology shifts would make your new EV obsolete anytime soon, predicting steady, incremental gains, mostly in battery range and model diversity. “Buying an EV is kind of like buying a desktop computer in the past,” says Undercoffler. “Every 12 months, a newer, faster, cheaper version comes out. But if you wait, then you’ll never buy a computer.” The one thing to look out for issolid-state batteries. But even those will take quite a long time. Today’s EVs generally rely on lithium-ion batteries. These use aliquid electrolyteto conduct electricity. Solid-state batteries replace this liquid with a solid, often ceramic material. Their primary advantage is that it allows manufacturers to packabout two times more energyinto the same space. Imagine a 500-pound, solid-state battery with the same range as today’s 1,000-pound lithium-ion packs. It can fully recharge in about10 minutes, with less risk of fire. It’s also quick and cheaper to manufacture. The catch? Solid-state batteries remain expensive, resource intensive and hard to recycle. Once those obstacles are overcome, they could be a game changer. But commercial production may be three to five years away, and mass-market adoptiona decade or more. The next decade will be the American “golden age” for electrified vehicles, says Sara Baldwin of Energy Innovation, an energy and environmental policy firm. That’s thanks largely to the Inflation Reduction Act, which offers buyers of eligible EVs a full ($7,500) or partial ($3,750) tax credit for vehicles made in the United States and supported by domestic supply chains or countries with free-trade agreements. But the criteria are byzantine. To qualify for the subsidies, all vehicles must be assembled in North America. Any vehicle with batteries or critical minerals from a still unspecified “foreign entity of concern” does not qualify. Rising percentages of batteries, battery components and critical minerals must also be sourced from North America or free-trade-agreement nations. Personal income and vehicle price limits apply. Confused? Don’t worry. So is one of the bill’s key authors, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.). The senator, who insisted EV subsidies be focused on American suppliers, recently admitted he was unaware that a free-trade agreement did not exist between the European Union and the United States — jeopardizing the bloc’s ability to compete in the United States. A trade deal is being worked out now. To help you out, I’ve added adecision tree below, produced by Energy Innovation, to tell if you and your vehicle qualify for federal incentives. Another way to figure this out? Wait until April 18. The Internal Revenue Service will issuean updated list of what vehicles qualifyunder the incentive program. The list is likely to shrink before it grows, as automakers must shift their supply chains toward North America and free-trade-agreement nations to meet increasingly stringent criteria. You can alsodetermine tax credit eligibility by looking up the vehicle identification number on this Energy Departmentwebsite. “Once the list is out here, it will be pretty straightforward,” says Baldwin. “That’s the good news.” And the federal government is considering even more stringent rules to pressure automakers to sell more EVs. One of the Environmental Protection Agency’sproposed auto emissions plans, the toughest one to date, would aim to have as many as two-thirds of all new passenger vehicles sold be electric by 2032. There’s one way to sidestep many of these restrictions: Lease an electric vehicle. Baldwin says all leased EVs qualify for the full $7,500 tax credit because auto dealers are eligible to take the tax credit as commercial entities. “For those eager to start driving an EV immediately and start saving on fuel costs, a leased EV may offer a great interim solution,” she says. A second option is buying used. It’s a much cheaper way into the EV market, and there are no restrictions on the make or model for a tax credit of 30 percent up to $4,000, assuming vehicle price and buyer income requirements are met.Check out this flow chartto see if you qualify. “This tax credit could prove to be a game changer for the market given that most people buy used vehicles today,” says Baldwin. And used-car prices are finally coming back down. On the high end, the automotive research companyiSeeCars.comfound electric models like the Audi e-tron, Volkswagen ID.4, and Ford Mustang Mach-E werediscounted by 20 percent or morebelow new-car prices on average, a savings of up to $23,000. “There are deals out there if you do some research,” says Karl Brauer ofiSeeCars.com. For a more affordable option, early versions of the Nissan Leaf, Ford Focus electric hatchback and Fiat 500eselling for $5,000 to $9,000can be found. Their battery range may be degraded to 50 miles or less, but if you want a city car or a second vehicle, older models might be the ticket. From a strictly financial standpoint, it’s better to wait if you can.New cars are a financial loss the moment you drive them off the lot,collectible Tesla Roadsters aside. “Buying a new car is never a good investment,” says Wakefield at AlixPartners. “These are depreciating assets.” Putting off the purchase until you really need it allows you to get the most out of your existing vehicle. But there are exceptions: Do you have a long commute? Are you still driving a 30-year-old gas guzzler? Did your old vehicle conk out? Then EVs can have a significantly lower lifetime cost and emissions. Electricity is generally cheaper and cleaner. Maintenance like brake pads and oil changes are not required. And EVs are expected tolast much longer, with some manufacturers talking aboutmillion-mile batteries. So if you need a car right now, you’re in a better place than even a few months ago. If you can wait, your bank account will thank you. But for many people, cars are not just rubber, metal and batteries. Asresearchersandmarketersrealize, a car purchase isnot an economically rational decision. It’s about what we value. For those who want to have less impact on the climate, and need a car, an EV might be worth every penny. A previous version of this article incorrectly said the Chevy Bolt's base price was $40,875.

3,Electric vehicles are hitting a road block: Car dealers,"As news started coming out aboutelectric carsin early 2016, Michael Young, a self-described “car guy,” knew he wanted to try one. One afternoon, he strolled into his local dealership and asked to test drive the BMW i3, a small, sporty car with a range of up to 150 miles. The salesperson stopped him. “You can’t drive that car on the highway,” Young recalls the salesperson saying, explaining that the car couldn’t go over 45 miles per hour. “I was kind of dumbfounded by that,” Young said. Young knew it could go much faster — and, after convincing the salesperson to let him go on a test drive,ultimately bought the i3. The experience motivated him to launch awebsitethat helps consumers shopfor electric vehicles. But the incident underscores a problem that still plagues electric vehicles: Many U.S. buyers say car dealerships, which sell the majority of new vehicles, are not prepared for the electric transition. The Biden administration aims to have as many as two-thirds of new cars sold in the United Statesbe electric by 2032; andautomakers have investedhundreds of billions of dollarsin EVs. But if car dealers don’t want to sell EVs, the country’s electric transition could be in jeopardy. Car sales are unlike any other commercial transactionin America. For most products — everything including shoes and iPhones — you can buy directly from the manufacturer or in dozens of other stores. Cars used to be the same: Before World War II, people bought personal vehicles at big-box department stores, from the manufacturers themselves and even at gas stations. But in the 1940s and 1950s, dealerships — which were mostly single-family businesses — argued that the powerful automakers could undercut their sales and drive them out of business. Over the next two decades, dozens of states passed laws to protect dealers; many of them prevented manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. In recent years, Tesla, which does not use car dealerships, has fought some ofthose laws in court. The company has won in some states and, in others, has received workarounds that allow a few select storefronts. Still, many automakers have to sell their vehicles through one of the country’s more than 16,000 franchisedauto dealerships. And those salespeople often don’t have extensive training on how to sell an EV or even on the technology itself. Frustrated customers told TheWashington Post that dealers tried to redirect their attention toward gas cars, or gave incorrect or unclear answers to questions about charging and day-to-day electric vehicle use. James Richards, the CEO of a water heating company in Davis, Calif., spent days test-driving EVs at Volkswagen, Tesla, Chevy and Ford. But the 40-year-old found the dealership experience “cringeworthy” — the dealers didn’t seem to know much about the EVs they were selling. “I felt like I knew more than they did,” Richards said. Initially, Richards was hoping to buy an F-150 Lightning, but the truck was back-ordered. The salesperson could only get him an expensive trim that came with a high dealer markup. That markup added “insult to injury,” Richards said. He ended up buying a Tesla Model Y. Tesla salespeople “strike you as EV geeks,” Richards explained. “All the other dealerships: Ford, VW, the GM people — they didn’t seem like specialists.” Maya Batres, a 34-year-old adviser for an environmental organization, bought a used Fiat 500e from a dealer in February 2022. The dealer, she said, didn’t know much about EVs but was happy to make the sale since she and her husband came prepared. But when it came time to sign the paperwork, the salesperson offered her a plan for oil changes and an extended warranty for a gas-powered car. “I knew we didn’t need that,” Batres said, laughing. Which electric vehicle is right for you? Check out our guide. EVs are complex. There are three types of charging ports and three different speeds of charging for electric vehicles. (Young recalls a salesman telling him that he could use Tesla’s charging network for a non-Tesla vehicle, long before the company beganopening their fast chargersto other cars.) Electric cars also often come with new features like one-pedal driving and adaptive cruise control. Then there is the maze offederal and state tax incentivesthat can help drivers afford a new or used EV — but only if the dealer and the consumer can understand how they work. Some dealers, however, don’t seem to want to offer electric cars: According to asurveythat the Sierra Club conducted at the end of 2022, 66 percent of dealerships did not have an EV available for sale. That was at the height of EV supply chain problems, but 45 percent of those dealers — or 30 percent of all dealers surveyed — said they wouldn’t offer an EV even if they could. Amid concern over an EV slowdown, electric cars are sitting longer on dealerships’ lots than gas-powered cars. According to data from Cox Automotive, dealerships started the year with a roughly 50 days’ supply of gas cars and electric cars. Now the supply of gas cars is around the same, but the supply of EVs has doubled. Dealers may have less economic incentive to sell electric vehicles. Buzz Smith, a former Chevrolet car salesman who now helps train dealers to sell EVs, says it can take muchlonger to sell an electric car than a gas-powered one. A gas car, he said, might take no more than an hour in a single visit to sell, yielding a tidy commission. But for electric vehicles, “it was usually four visits, an hour each, before they would buy the EV,” Smith said. Customers want to make sure they understand the technology, how to charge it and more. “So I’m volunteering to take a 75 percent pay cut — and no salesman wants to do that.” Smith said he believes the pay structure of auto salespeople isn’t a good fit for the EV era. Electric cars have narrower profit margins, he said, which cuts into the commission a dealer can get. And if a customer returns to the dealership multiple times, salespeople may have to split the commission, again cutting into their take-home pay. At the same time, car dealerships make most of their overall profits from providing service for vehicles — not selling new cars.According to ananalysisfrom the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, just 16 percent of dealers’ gross profits came from new car sales, while 43 percent came from parts, labor and service. (The rest of the profits come from used car sales and financing and incentives.) “It’s a lot like giving away the razor to sell the blade,” said Daniel Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan who studies the laws and economics of car dealerships. That could also discourage dealers from selling EVs. Gas cars have 100 times more moving parts than electric vehicles do, and studies show that EVs have lower maintenance costs. An average gas-powered car, for example, needs an oil change about every six months, or every 5,000 to 7,500 miles. But many electric cars don’t require a major service until around150,000 miles. “They’re all terrified of that loss of maintenance,” Smith said. But EVs are still new enough, Smith said, that customers will return to dealers because they don’t want their neighborhood mechanic to try to service their car. Some dealers are working to embrace the new technology. Claire McDonald, the president of a Ford dealership in Waco, Tex., said her salespeople were excited to do the training thatthe automaker offered on how to sell EVs. “It’s a part of our future,” she said. They’ve only sold a dozen or so electric cars so far, she said, but she sees it as a key part of the business model going forward. “I’m not here to push EVs, for or against,” she added. “I’m here to help our customers understand their needs.” Mike Stanton, the president and CEO of the National Automobile Dealers Association, says dealerships have invested around $6 billion in preparing to sell and service electric vehicles. “Dealers have stepped up and done what is needed,” he said. But Stanton said the EV transition — especially with the Biden administration’s aggressive goals on electric car sales — is moving too quickly. “This is going way too far,” Stanton said. “We’ve got to consider the mainstream market, or bad things are going to happen.” Others — like Crane, who has submitted legal briefs supporting direct-to-consumer sales — say that the dealership-only model simply isn’t suited for the electric future — and may add to a car’s price tag. “Dealers don’t want to change the model,” he said. “They want to be the gatekeepers.”",washington-post,east-coast,news started

4,Why EVs won’t crash the electric grid — and more,"Climate Coach readers are thinking hard about the next industrial revolution. Thefirst energy transitionfrom biomass to fossil fuels transformed society in the 1700s. The next one will tap carbon-free energy to “electrify everything.” How this will come together remains unclear. So this week, I’ll answer a few of your questions, lightly edited for brevity and clarity, on the markets and infrastructure that need to support the transition. Then we’ll take a look at Japan, whereemissions have fallen steeply since 2012.Might it offer a lesson for the United States? Have something on your mind? You can submit questions by email atclimatecoach@washpost.com, or join one of myLive ChatsorPost Reportspodcasts to ask in real time. Let’s begin. If everyone has an electric car, will the electric grid be able to support all those cars being recharged? And if something should happen to the grid, such as what happened in Texas a few winters ago, are we all back to the horse and buggy?—Sherry in North Carolina via email We can already see a preview of our electric future in Norway, one of the countries with the highest share of EVs.More than 90 percentof new cars sold in the country were plug-in electric, according to the latest data, from May.More than 20 percentof the country’s overall vehicle fleet is electric, a share expected to rise to one-third by 2025. So far, the grid has essentially shrugged it off. “We haven’t seen any issue of the grid collapsing,”says Anne Nysæther, a managing director at Elvia, a utility serving Oslo and the surrounding areas with the nation’s largest concentration of EVs. The country, now almostentirely powered by renewables, has easily met the extra demand from EVs whileslashing greenhouse gas emissions. That’s good, because Norway will ban all new petrol anddiesel carsby 2025. The United Statesisn’t nearly as far along. Only8.4 percent of new car saleswere plug-in electric in the first quarter of 2023. But sales are growing fast:The White House wantshalf of all new automobile salesto be electric by 2030. To electrify everything — all these expected EVs, heat pumps and other big power draws — we’ll need to start building up our grid,according to Jesse Jenkins, an energy modeling and engineering expert at Princeton University. The United States must at least double its electricity supply by 2050, while stringing up 75,000 miles of new high-voltage lines by 2035, the equivalent of 15 round trips from Los Angeles to New York City, and connect new wind and solar generation to the grid. That sounds like a lot. But something like this has already been done. From the 1970s to the 1990s, the U.S. built new transmission capacity at a speed close to what is required today,writes Jenkins inMother Jones,even as electricity demand grew. In fact, battery electric vehicles can bepart of this solution. EVs are energy storage on wheels. Rather than charging at peak hours, EVs can soak up cheap, renewable electrons from solar during midday or from wind late at night. With a smart system to coordinate them, EVs should not overstress the grid. The challenge is intelligently managing how the load is distributed,not building a bunch of new power plants just for EVs. What does a solar system add to the value of a house for resale? — Pennyvia live chat Historically, solar adds value. A 2013Berkeley National Laboratory studyanalyzing 1,894 home sales in California showed buyers consistently paid higher premiums for homes with solar photovoltaic panels, which were compared to upgrades such as renovating a kitchen or bathroom. To get an idea of how much your panels boost your home’s value, take a look at how much they save you each year on your electricity bill.The National Renewable Energy Laboratory also cites datashowing “solar increases home value by $20 for every $1 reduction in annual utility bills.” A solar energy system that reduces your annual utility bill by $200, for example, theoretically adds about $4,000 to the resale value of the home. Yet the exact percentage is hard to pin down, since it’s related to factors such as geography, utility rates, the age of your solar panels, and the local real estate market. The real estate firm Zillowlooked at sales datafrom 2018 to 2019. It concluded homes with solar-energy systems sold for 4.1 percent more than comparable homes without solar power, an additional $9,274 on average. But that finding hasn’t stayed consistent, says Amanda Pendleton, who directs home trends research for Zillow. In Zillow’s most recent analysis of sales of 1.98 million homes listed in 2022, homes with solar panels did not command a premium, probably because of the exceptionally tight and expensive housing market, she suspects. “Affordability is the biggest challenge for home buyers today,” she says. “People say they want it, but at the end of the day, the question is what can they afford.” Generally speaking, the more you save on energy, the more this should increase the value of your home. But your mileage may vary. I find there are good things happening embracing history and modernism and ecology in Japan, developing and linking community with city public transport, country hiking trails, historic roads and towns viewed from ecology-minded optimism. — Junco Pollack via email In 2005, Japan’s prime minister made an urgent call to his top environmental official: The country needed to slash its greenhouse gas emissions. The Kyoto Protocol had just entered into force and Japan’s emissions were rising. To avoid an embarrassing failure to meet the climate treaty’s targets, environment minister Yuriko Koikesought a way to cut Japan’s emissionsin years not decades. Office buildings offered an enticing target. Commercial buildings have the potential for enormous emission reductions. In most industrialized countries, they’re responsible formore than 10 percent of countries’ greenhouse gas emissions. Rather than appeal to people’s sense of environmental duty, Koike transformed their workplace culture instead. The ministry launchedCool Biz, a new clothing brand in collaboration with the textile and fashion industries, featuring cooler, breathable materials. Famous Japanese CEOs modeled the styles on the runway. The new clothes meant offices could cut back on air conditioning.In public buildings, jackets were banned for government workers. Office thermostats were allowed to rise to 28 degrees Celsius (82 degrees Fahrenheit) in the summer. Researchersestimatethe Cool Biz initiative slashed carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to the annual output of several natural gas power plants. I share this story not because it is the solution to climate change — Japan’s culture is unique — but because it illustrates the types of solutions we should be exploring. Oftentimes, the most effective fixescome from rethinking old ideas, shifting social norms, and learning from others with very different experiences.

5,Most electric vehicles won’t qualify for federal tax credit,"DETROIT — A tax credit of up to $7,500 could be used to defray the cost of an electric vehicle under the Inflation Reduction Act now moving toward final approval in Congress. But the auto industry is warning that the vast majority of EV purchases won’t qualify for a tax credit that large. That’s mainly because of the bill’s requirement that, to qualify for the credit, an electric vehicle must contain a battery built in North America with minerals mined or recycled on the continent. And those rules become more stringent over time — to the point where, in a few years, it’s possible that no EVs would qualify for the tax credit, says John Bozzella, CEO of the Alliance of Automotive Innovation, a key industry trade group. As of now, the alliance estimates that about 50 of the 72 electric, hydrogen or plug-in hybrid models that are sold in the United States wouldn’t meet the requirements. “The $7,500 credit might exist on paper,” Bozzella said in a statement, “but no vehicles will qualify for this purchase over the next few years.” The idea behind the requirement is to incentivize domestic manufacturing, build a robust battery supply chain in North America and lessen the industry’s dependence on overseas supply chains that could be subject to disruptions. Production of lithium and other minerals that are used to produce EV batteries is now dominated by China. And the world’s leading producer of cobalt, another component of the EV batteries, is the Democratic Republic of Congo. Though electric vehicles are part of a global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they require metallic elements known as rare earths, found in places like Myanmar, where an Associated Press investigation has found that the push for green energy has led to environmental destruction. Under the $740 billion economic package, which passed the Senate over the weekend and is nearing approval in the House, the tax credits would take effect next year. For an EV buyer to qualify for the full credit, 40% of the metals used in a vehicle’s battery must come from North America. By 2027, that required threshold would reach 80%. If the metals requirement isn’t met, the automaker and its buyers would be eligible for half the tax credit, $3,750. A separate rule would require that half the batteries’ value must be manufactured or assembled in the North America. If not, the rest of the tax credit would be lost. Those requirements also grow stricter each year, eventually reaching 100% in 2029. Still another rule would require that the EV itself be manufactured in North America, thereby excluding from the tax credit any vehicles made overseas. Automakers generally don’t release where their components come from or how much they cost. But it’s likely that some versions of Tesla’s Model Y SUV and Model 3 car, the Chevrolet Bolt car and SUV and the Ford Mustang Mach E would be eligible for at least part of the credit. All those vehicles are assembled in North America. The tax credit would be available only to couples with incomes of $300,000 or less or single people with income of $150,000 or less. And any trucks or SUVs with sticker prices above $80,000 or cars above $55,000 wouldn’t be eligible. There’s also a new $4,000 credit for buyers of used EVs, a provision that could help modest-income households go electric. The industry says the North American battery supply chain is too small right now to meet the battery component requirements. It has proposed that the measure expand the list of countries whose battery materials would be eligible for the tax credit to nations that maintain defense agreements with the United States, including NATO members. One component of the bill would require that after 2024, no vehicle would be eligible for the tax credit if its battery components came from China. Most vehicles now have some parts sourced in China, the alliance said. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat and a leading ally of Detroit automakers, complained that Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a critical Democratic vote, had opposed any tax credits for EV purchases. “I went round-and-round with Senator Manchin, who frankly didn’t support any credit of any kind, so this is a compromise,” Stabenow told reporters Monday. “We’ll work through it and make this as good as we can for our automakers.” Manchin, long a holdout Democrat who negotiated terms of the deal with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, had blocked previous climate and social spending proposals. Manchin’s office declined to comment. Stabenow asserted that the bill was written by people who don’t understand that manufacturers can’t simply flip a switch and create a North American supply chain, though they are working on it. Numerous automakers, including General Motors, Ford, Stellantis, Toyota and Hyundai-Kia, have announced plans to build EV battery plants in the United States. Stabenow said she remains hopeful that the Biden administration can offer the tax credits next year while it works on the detailed rules for the battery requirements. “We will continue to work with the automakers and the administration on getting as much common sense into the regulations as possible,” the senator said. Messages were left Monday seeking comment from the White House and the Treasury Department, which would administer the credits.

6,Dan Rodricks: All charged up for an electric car? Getting an affordable one is still a challenge. | COMMENTARY,"If you own an electric car or truck, or drive a hybrid plug-in, congratulations: You’ve made it to the 1%. At the end of July, there were 52,966 EVs or hybrid plug-ins registered in Maryland. That’s just 1% of all motor vehicles across the state. It has been 25 years since the first generation of the Toyota Prius — albeit a hybrid, not a hybrid plug-in with a larger battery — came off the assembly line. Since then, there’s been immense progress in battery technology, along with greater political and cultural acceptance of the environmental need to move away from gas-powered automobiles. So, given all that, you’d think Maryland, one of the wealthiest, highest educated, eco-conscious and bluest states in the country, would be further along in the purchase of emissions-free vehicles. “One percent doesn’t sound like much,” says R. Earl Lewis Jr., a deputy secretary of the Maryland Department of Transportation. “But it is, when you look at the growth rates. We had 52,966 [EVs] at the end of July. We had 600 in 2012.” That suggests significant public buy-in of a still developing technology. If not for the pandemic, the state might have reached its goal of 60,000 EVs by 2020. It’s becoming increasingly clear that more people are enticed into the cool idea of owning battery-powered cars with only 20 moving parts and no gas tank. Current sales are robust. Just between the end of May and the end of July, another 4,575 EVs were registered in Maryland. People have noticed important developments. Battery capacity is increasing along with battery production. The driving range of EVs has improved significantly. (Both the Chevy Bolt EV and the Hyundai Kona EV can get close to 260 miles on a single charge.) The price of gasoline, rigged on the global market, has people thinking about making the transition. And the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act, passed by the Senate and House — with all Republicans opposed, of course — renews tax credits of up to $7,500 for EVs that are assembled in North America and powered by batteries made with “critical minerals’' that come from the U.S. or countries with which we have free trade agreements. So there’s somefine print involved in the incentives— because of their high price tags, some models won’t be eligible for them — and all of that makes the buyer’s calculations more challenging. Still, the incentives will last a decade and should give sales in the U.S. market a significant boost, particularly among middle-class consumers. That’s the hope anyway. Biggest issue: The price point for EVs is intimidating right now. The average electric car price in the U.S. hit $66,000 in July, according to Electrek, the EV news website. Demand has dealers marking up prices. When I recently inquired about the cost of one of the more affordable EVs, a Baltimore-area dealer added $5,000 on top of the manufacturer’s suggested retail price “due to the global microchip shortage as well as the supply chain crisis.” That pushed the sale price to just short of $40,000. On the other hand, another dealer offered a manufacturer’s rebate on a comparable, four-door EV, lowering the cost to about $37,000. Timing is everything — in love, comedy and buying an EV. The federal incentives are significant, but it might be wise for the Maryland General Assembly to again offer a tax credit for the purchase of a new or used EV, aimed at Marylanders of modest means who think EVs are priced out of their reach. While the sales and marketing gets sorted, the infrastructure to support the EV future expands. “I think there’s a bright future for EVs,” says Lewis. As a deputy secretary of transportation, he serves as chairman of — stand by for the long title — theMaryland Zero Emission Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Council. That’s the group planning for the EV future, building out the electrical infrastructure to increase citizen confidence in making the transition. Havingenough charging stationson or near highways is critical. A friend of mine, ecstatic about owning one of the first Chevy Bolts, sold the car after a couple of years because he could not find enough fast-charge stations between his home in Harford County and his hunting grounds in Maine. Another friend loves his Bolt but only recently felt confident that he could locate a charging station, if needed, between Baltimore and Deep Creek Lake, in the Western part of the state. The current Bolts, the EUV and EV, have, respectively, ranges of 247 and 258 miles on one charge, and while that sounds great for daily commutes, it’s longer trips that give some people pause about going electric. So expanding the number ofcharging stationsis a huge piece of the EV future. According to the Department of Transportation, there are now 1,241 stations with 3,373 charging outlets in Maryland. And there’s more to come, says Lewis, with some $60 million in federal funds slated over the next five years for Maryland’s EV corridors. The plan is for a charging station every 50 miles, and within one mile of a highway. So, if all that holds, if the price points come down, if the incentives work, then Lewis is correct about a bright future for EVs in Maryland. Just think: Baltimore to Ocean City on a little more than half a charge and no gas.",baltimoresun,east-coast,electric car truck drive hybrid plugin congratulations made 1 end july 52966 evs hybrid plugins registered maryland 1 motor vehicles across state 25 years since first generation toyota prius albeit hybrid hybrid plugin larger battery came assembly line since immense progress battery technology along greater political cultural acceptance environmental need move away gaspowered automobiles given would think maryland one wealthiest highest educated ecoconscious bluest states country would along purchase emissionsfree vehicles one percent sound like much says r earl lewis jr deputy secretary maryland department transportation look growth rates 52966 evs end july 600 2012 suggests significant public buyin still developing technology pandemic state might reached goal 60000 evs 2020 becoming increasingly clear people enticed cool idea owning batterypowered cars 20 moving parts gas tank current sales robust end may end july another 4575 evs registered maryland people noticed important developments battery capacity increasing along battery production driving range evs improved significantly chevy bolt ev hyundai kona ev get close 260 miles single charge price gasoline rigged global market people thinking making transition democrats inflation reduction act passed senate house republicans opposed course renews tax credits 7500 evs assembled north america powered batteries made critical minerals come yous countries free trade agreements somefine print involved incentives high price tags models eligible makes buyers calculations challenging still incentives last decade give sales yous market significant boost particularly among middleclass consumers hope anyway biggest issue price point evs intimidating right average electric car price yous hit 66000 july according electrek ev news website demand dealers marking prices recently inquired cost one affordable evs baltimorearea dealer added 5000 top manufacturers suggested retail price due global microchip shortage well supply chain crisis pushed sale price short 40000 hand another dealer offered manufacturers rebate comparable fourdoor ev lowering cost 37000 timing everything love comedy buying ev federal incentives significant might wise maryland general assembly offer tax credit purchase new used ev aimed marylanders modest means think evs priced reach sales marketing gets sorted infrastructure support ev future expands think bright future evs says lewis deputy secretary transportation serves chairman stand long title themaryland zero emission electric vehicle infrastructure council group planning ev future building electrical infrastructure increase citizen confidence making transition havingenough charging stationson near highways critical friend mine ecstatic owning one first chevy bolts sold car couple years could find enough fastcharge stations home harford county hunting grounds maine another friend loves bolt recently felt confident could locate charging station needed baltimore deep creek lake western part state current bolts euv ev respectively ranges 247 258 miles one charge sounds great daily commutes longer trips give people pause going electric expanding number ofcharging stationsis huge piece ev future according department transportation 1241 stations 3373 charging outlets maryland come says lewis 60 million federal funds slated next five years marylands ev corridors plan charging station every 50 miles within one mile highway holds price points come incentives work lewis correct bright future evs maryland think baltimore ocean city little half charge gas,08-16-2022
7,Rivian electric car plant blasted by foes at Georgia meeting,"MONROE, Ga. — Opponents trying to derail a $5 billion, 7,500-job electric truck plant in Georgia dominated a state meeting this week that was meant to gather suggestions on how to design the plant to mitigate any impact on the environment. The state assumed oversight over the Rivian Automotive project after opponents overwhelmed Morgan County planning and zoning officials. The plant was announced by the company and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in December, and is the biggest single industrial project in state history. The first meeting of one of the oversight committees was Monday in the city of Monroe. The Irvine, California-based electric vehicle manufacturer announced last year that it would build the facility on a 2,000-acre (809-hectare) site in Morgan and Walton counties about 45 miles (72 kilometers) east of Atlanta along Interstate 20. It plans to produce up to 400,000 vehicles a year there. Rivian, which also has a plant in Normal, Illinois, said it hopes to break ground as early as this summer and begin production in 2024. The state panel, led by John Eunice, deputy director for the state Environmental Protection Division, did not get much cooperation from a hostile crowd that gathered at Athens Technical College in Monroe, news outlets reported. Opposition to the plant has been heavy from Rutledge-area residents who say the plant will spoil their rural quality of life. Residents criticized the meeting as a sham, saying it’s impossible to make meaningful suggestions when there’s not yet a plant design and saying the state is only working to get the plant built. “I was sitting at home and I saw my governor get on TV and say Rivian, 2,000-acre plant, coming to Rutledge, Georgia and it’s a done deal,” said Pam Jones. Gov. Brian Kemp stands next to a Rivian electric truck while announcing the company's plans to build a $5 billion plant east of Atlanta projected to employ 7,500 workers, Dec. 16, 2021, in Atlanta.(John Bazemore/AP) Many speakers Monday voiced concerns about possible well-water contamination, light pollution, and the disruption of wildlife habitats and farmland for heavy industry. “I don’t understand why you are sitting on that side of the table, which is the Rivian side of the table and why you’re not sitting over here asking Rivian and Gov. Kemp to explain this environmental project and how it’s a disaster,” said Edwin Snell of Oconee County. A Rivian executive was present via video conference but did not speak during the hearing. A spokesperson for Rivian said the meeting was a valuable opportunity for the company to gather input and that the company is committed to sharing details of their plans for the site once they are complete and “meet our own high design and environmental standards.” The plant is a subject of contention in Georgia’s Republican primary for governor, with former U.S. Sen. David Perdue attacking Kemp for agreeing to the Rivian location without support from neighbors. Eunice said he does not know when Rivian will file for environmental permits needed to build the facility. He said the division will take public comment on the permits. Monday’s meeting was the first of four planned for the site design and environmental committee. The state plans four meetings each with three other committees tasked with examining quality of life, workforce and local business engagement issues.",baltimoresun,east-coast,monroe ga opponents trying derail 5 billion 7500job electric truck plant georgia dominated state meeting week meant gather suggestions design plant mitigate impact environment state assumed oversight rivian automotive project opponents overwhelmed morgan county planning zoning officials plant announced company georgia gov brian kemp december biggest single industrial project state history first meeting one oversight committees monday city monroe irvine californiabased electric vehicle manufacturer announced last year would build facility 2000acre 809hectare site morgan walton counties 45 miles 72 kilometers east atlanta along interstate 20 plans produce 400000 vehicles year rivian also plant normal illinois said hopes break ground early summer begin production 2024 state panel led john eunice deputy director state environmental protection division get much cooperation hostile crowd gathered athens technical college monroe news outlets reported opposition plant heavy rutledgearea residents say plant spoil rural quality life residents criticized meeting sham saying impossible make meaningful suggestions yet plant design saying state working get plant built sitting home saw governor get tv say rivian 2000acre plant coming rutledge georgia done deal said pam jones gov brian kemp stands next rivian electric truck announcing companys plans build 5 billion plant east atlanta projected employ 7500 workers december 16 2021 atlantajohn bazemoreap many speakers monday voiced concerns possible wellwater contamination light pollution disruption wildlife habitats farmland heavy industry understand sitting side table rivian side table sitting asking rivian gov kemp explain environmental project disaster said edwin snell oconee county rivian executive present via video conference speak hearing spokesperson rivian said meeting valuable opportunity company gather input company committed sharing details plans site complete meet high design environmental standards plant subject contention georgias republican primary governor former yous sen david perdue attacking kemp agreeing rivian location without support neighbors eunice said know rivian file environmental permits needed build facility said division take public comment permits mondays meeting first four planned site design environmental committee state plans four meetings three committees tasked examining quality life workforce local business engagement issues,04-20-2022
8,"Hogan administration won’t match California’s electric cars rule this year, frustrating Maryland advocates","Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s administration won’t be putting forward a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035 — mimicking a decision by California — before he leaves office. Environmental advocates had been hoping the Republican governor’s administration would advance a policy matching California’s before the end of the year. They argue that, by waiting,Maryland could fall behind California, where 35% of new light-duty cars sold must be zero-emission in model year 2026. Maryland must give manufacturers two model years of notice before the rule takes effect. A 2007 state law mandates that Maryland follow California’s vehicle emissions standards, which are stricter than the federal government’s. Several other states havesimilar arrangements. But the process is in the hands of Hogan’s Department of the Environment. The department decided to wait on a final approval of California’s rule by that state’s Office of Administrative Law, said MDE spokesman Jay Apperson. That approval came Nov. 30, after the policy was approved by the California Air Resources Board in August. To begin the process in Maryland, MDE must submit a policy to theAir Quality Control Advisory Board, which held its last meeting of the year Monday. Its next meeting is scheduled for March 13. Now, implementing the policy will fall to incoming Democratic Gov. Wes Moore’s administration. In a statement Wednesday, Brian Jones, a spokesman for the Moore transition team, said the administration will “work expeditiously to meet the goals adopted by the legislature” in accordance with the 2007 law. “The urgency and leadership that Gov. Elect Moore will bring to combating climate change were made clear during the campaign,” Jones added. Atthe air quality board’s meetingMonday, Lindsey Mendelson, transportation representative with the Maryland Sierra Club, said she was disappointed that the policy was not on the agenda for December. “This should be low-hanging fruit,” she said. “Manufacturers are already supporting this, [Office of Administrative Law] finalized it in California, other states are moving on it. So, if we don’t adopt it this year, it cannot be enforced in 2025, or model year 2026. We’ll be falling behind.” In response, Chris Hoagland, director of MDE’s Air and Radiation Administration, confirmed that the policy won’t be advanced in Maryland this year. “It’s the department’s intent to bring [the policy] to this council at a future meeting as soon as we can,” Hoagland said. Several Maryland legislatorsalso called on Hogan’s administrationto take action before year’s end. Montgomery County Democratic Dels. David Fraser-Hidalgo, Kumar Barve and Marc Korman sent aletterearlier this year pushing for a 2022 adoption of the policy. The Maryland Commission on Climate Change also recommended the standard be enacted this year to help meet the state’s greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. In a statement, Apperson said that Hogan’s administration “continues to conduct an interagency review” of the electric cars rule. In addition, Apperson added, the federal Environmental Protection Agency still must review California’s action. Under Republican President Donald Trump, the EPA revoked California’s ability to enact stricter vehicle emissions standards than the federal government. But President Joe Biden’s EPAreversed that decision this year.",baltimoresun,east-coast,maryland gov larry hogans administration putting forward ban sale new gaspowered cars 2035 mimicking decision california leaves office environmental advocates hoping republican governors administration would advance policy matching californias end year argue waitingmaryland could fall behind california 35 new lightduty cars sold must zeroemission model year 2026 maryland must give manufacturers two model years notice rule takes effect 2007 state law mandates maryland follow californias vehicle emissions standards stricter federal governments several states havesimilar arrangements process hands hogans department environment department decided wait final approval californias rule states office administrative law said mde spokesman jay apperson approval came november 30 policy approved california air resources board august begin process maryland mde must submit policy theair quality control advisory board held last meeting year monday next meeting scheduled march 13 implementing policy fall incoming democratic gov wes moores administration statement wednesday brian jones spokesman moore transition team said administration work expeditiously meet goals adopted legislature accordance 2007 law urgency leadership gov elect moore bring combating climate change made clear campaign jones added atthe air quality boards meetingmonday lindsey mendelson transportation representative maryland sierra club said disappointed policy agenda december lowhanging fruit said manufacturers already supporting office administrative law finalized california states moving adopt year enforced 2025 model year 2026 well falling behind response chris hoagland director mdes air radiation administration confirmed policy advanced maryland year departments intent bring policy council future meeting soon hoagland said several maryland legislatorsalso called hogans administrationto take action years end montgomery county democratic dels david fraserhidalgo kumar barve marc korman sent aletterearlier year pushing 2022 adoption policy maryland commission climate change also recommended standard enacted year help meet states greenhouse gas emission reduction targets statement apperson said hogans administration continues conduct interagency review electric cars rule addition apperson added federal environmental protection agency still must review californias action republican president donald trump epa revoked californias ability enact stricter vehicle emissions standards federal government president joe bidens epareversed decision year,12-14-2022
9,"California electric vehicle rule takes another step forward in Maryland, after hold-up under Gov. Larry Hogan","Maryland took a big step Monday toward eventually requiring all new vehicles sold in the state to be electric, with the state Air Quality Control Advisory Council’s unanimous approval of a regulation implementing California’s vehicle emissions standards. Under existing state law, Maryland is required to match California’s vehicle emissions programs, but Republican Gov. Larry Hogandelayed the rollout, meaning Maryland’s rule will take effect at least one model year later than the Golden State’s. The proposal requires anincreasing percentage of new carssold in Maryland to be zero-emission vehicles, starting with 43% in model year 2027. By model year 2035, all new passenger vehicles sold in the state would need to be zero-emission. Plug-in hybrid cars with at least 50 miles of all-electric range are allowed to account for 20% of the requirements. During a news conference Monday at the Maryland Department of the Environment headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore touted his administration’s ability to bring the regulation forward less than two months after his inauguration. “The last administration pumped the brakes on this regulation, but today I am proud to say that we’re getting rolling again,” said Moore, a Democrat. After his remarks, Moore hopped behind the wheel of an orange Ford Mustang Mach-E and took a spin around the parking lot — with a state trooper keeping a watchful eye in the passenger seat. Gov. Wes Moore drove an EV car around the parking lot after a news conference at the Maryland Department of the Environment headquarters.(Karl Merton Ferron/Baltimore Sun) “Doing good shouldn’t be that fun,” he told reporters from behind the wheel. The rule is expected to be finalized around September of this year, said Justin Mabrey of the Maryland Department of the Environment’s Mobile Sources Control Program. Before then, the public will be given an opportunity to comment and the rule will receive an advisory review from a legislative committee. In a news release Monday, Republicans in the Maryland House of Delegates blasted Moore’s decision to move forward with the program, and promoted a Republican-sponsored bill to evaluate the policy’s impact on the state’s economy and electrical grid before implementation. “This is a policy that was created in California. It is based on California’s economy, California’s transportation needs, and California’s electrical grid,” said House Minority Leader Jason Buckel in a statement. Environmental groups, including the Maryland League of Conservation Voters and the Maryland Sierra Club, applauded the Moore administration’s decision to move forward with the regulation Monday. “I’ve been doing this work for a long time, and I dream of a day like today,” said Kim Coble, executive director of the Maryland League of Conservation Voters, who served on Moore’s transition team and co-chairs the Maryland Commission on Climate Change. During model year 2026 — the gap year separating California and Maryland’s programs — car manufacturers likely will be able to earn early compliance credits if more than 7% of the vehicles they sell in Maryland are electric cars. That percentage is the requirement for model year 2025 under existing law, Mabrey said. Once the program takes effect, manufacturers also would be able to trade zero-emission vehicle credits to help meet the requirement in the program’s early years, Mabrey said. So far, 17 states have adopted all or part of California’s standards, known as Advanced Clean Cars II, Mabrey said. Maryland is not the only state running a year behind California. New Jersey, for example, did not put forward the regulation in time to give manufacturers two years of notice before the rule takes effect, and is likely to start with model year 2027, too. Maryland legislatorscurrently are debating a similar requirementfor new, heavy-duty vehicles sold in the state, including trucks and buses. That standard also comes from California, where it is known as the Advanced Clean Trucks rule. In December  2021, California also finalized its “Heavy Duty Omnibus” regulation, which aims to reduce NOx emissions from heavy-duty trucks. During Monday’s air quality council meeting, Chris Hoagland, MDE’s director of air and radiation, said the administration technically doesn’t need approval from legislators to move forward with both rules for heavy-duty vehicles, though clarity from Annapolis would be welcomed. “Whether the legislation passes or not, we hope to bring Advanced Clean Trucks and omnibus to you all for consideration,” Hoagland said. Restricted from being able to drive on public streets for security reasons, Wes Moore (D), governor of Maryland putzes back and forth in a new all-electric Mach-E Mustang on the parking lot during a media event at Maryland Department of the Environment's Montgomery Park location, reinforcing the Moore administration's commitment to keeping the state on track to achieve its climate goals.(Karl Merton Ferron/Baltimore Sun) Despite a unanimous vote in favor of the regulation, some members of the air quality council — which includes industry groups, a physician, academics and advocacy groups — expressed concerns about insufficient charging infrastructure in the state to accommodate an influx of electric cars. “Right now, it’s like finding the Easter egg to find charging at most local shopping centers,” said Ross Salawitch, a University of Maryland professor serving on the air quality council. In a letter to the Maryland air quality council, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation expressed concern that the policy includes “staggering required sales increases for a new technology that relies heavily on customer acceptance and market readiness.” As of 2022, about 7.86% of the vehicles sold in Maryland were electric, according to the Alliance. To improve on that number, the Alliance recommended an increase in public charging stations, including at transportation hubs such as airports. It also recommended the adoption of building codes addressing the need for electric vehicle charging stations. The state has about 1,300 public charging stations, said Timothy Shepherd, chief of MDE’s engineering and technology assessment division — an 18-to-1 ratio of vehicles to chargers. The administration has a goal of reaching 15-to-1, he said. But many electric vehicle drivers do the bulk of their charging either at their homes or their workplaces, Shepherd said. “There’s been a lot of focus to kind of cover what people want first, as we start to build out the program,” Shepherd said. “Obviously [highway] corridors will play an important role and shopping centers. But right now, the interest from most EV drivers is workplace and residential.” After passing the Advanced Clean Cars II regulation Monday, the air quality council agreed to draft a letter encouraging other relevant state boards to advance electric car infrastructure projects, including by exploring changes to the state building code. During Monday’s news conference at MDE, officials said they recognize the need for Maryland to improve its charging infrastructure as more electric vehicles hit the road. “It won’t be enough to just move forward with this regulation and then to simply call that alone a victory,” Moore said. “That is why my administration is focused on ensuring that Maryland leads on tax credits and rebates for folks who buy electric. It’s why we’re focusing on Maryland leading on building out a network of electric car charging stations.” Moore referenced his administration’s bill, the Clean Transportation and Energy Act, which would provide businesses and local governments with rebates to cover the difference in cost between medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicles and gas-powered ones, and expands a rebate program for charging equipment. The bill remains in committee. Brendan Jones, president of Blink Charging, spoke during the news conference about his company’s production of electric vehicle chargers at SemaConnect in Bowie. The business received a contract to produce chargers for the U.S. Postal Service, Jones said, and is planning to scale up production by adding a new site close to its Bowie location. “We’ve already made the financial commitment on that. It’s millions and millions of dollars,” he said. “We’ll have that facility up and running within the next six months here in Maryland.”",baltimoresun,east-coast,maryland took big step monday toward

10,How Green Are Electric Vehicles?,"Advertisement Supported by In short: Very green. But plug-in cars still have environmental effects. Here’s a guide to the main issues and how they might be addressed. ByHiroko TabuchiandBrad Plumer Open this articlein the New York Times Audio app on iOS. Around the world, governments and automakers are promotingelectric vehiclesas a key technology to curb oil use and fight climate change. General Motors has said it aims to stop selling newgasoline-powered carsand light trucks by 2035 and will pivot to battery-powered models. This week, Volvo said it would move even faster and introduce an all-electric lineup by 2030. But aselectric carsand trucks go mainstream, they have faced a persistent question: Are they really as green as advertised? While experts broadly agree that plug-in vehicles are a more climate-friendly option than traditional vehicles, they can still have their own environmental impacts, depending on how they’re charged up and manufactured. Here’s a guide to some of the biggest worries — and how they might be addressed. Broadly speaking, mostelectric carssold todaytend to produce significantly fewer planet-warming emissionsthan most cars fueled with gasoline. But a lot depends on how much coal is being burned to charge up those plug-in vehicles. And electric grids still need to get much, much cleaner before electric vehicles are truly emissions free. One way to compare the climate impacts of different vehicle models is with thisinteractive online toolby researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who tried to incorporate all the relevant factors: the emissions involved in manufacturing the cars and in producing gasoline and diesel fuel, how much gasoline conventional cars burn, and where the electricity to charge electric vehicles comes from. If you assume electric vehicles are drawing their power from the average grid in the United States, which typically includes a mix of fossil fuel and renewable power plants, then they’re almost always much greener than conventional cars. Even though electric vehicles are more emissions-intensive to make because of their batteries, their electric motors are more efficient than traditional internal combustion engines that burn fossil fuels. An all-electric Chevrolet Bolt, for instance, can be expected to produce 189 grams of carbon dioxide for every mile driven over its lifetime, on average. By contrast, a new gasoline-fueled Toyota Camry is estimated to produce 385 grams of carbon dioxide per mile. A new Ford F-150 pickup truck, which is even less fuel-efficient, produces 636 grams of carbon dioxide per mile. But that’s just an average. On the other hand, if the Bolt is charged up on a coal-heavy grid, such as those currently found in the Midwest, it can actually be a bit worse for the climate than a modern hybrid car like the Toyota Prius, which runs on gasoline but uses a battery to bolster its mileage. (The coal-powered Bolt would still beat the Camry and the F-150, however.) “Coal tends to be the critical factor,” said Jeremy Michalek, a professor of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. “If you’ve got electric cars in Pittsburgh that are being plugged in at night and leading nearby coal plants to burn more coal to charge them, then the climate benefits won’t be as great, and you can even get more air pollution.” The good news for electric vehicles is that most countries are now pushing to clean up their electric grids. In the United States, utilities have retired hundreds of coal plants over the last decade and shifted to a mix of lower-emissions natural gas, wind and solar power. As a result, researchershave found, electric vehicles have generally gotten cleaner, too. And they are likely to get cleaner still. “The reason electric vehicles look like an appealing climate solution is that if we can make our grids zero-carbon, then vehicle emissions drop way, way down,” said Jessika Trancik, an associate professor of energy studies at M.I.T. “Whereas even the best hybrids that burn gasoline will always have a baseline of emissions they can’t go below.” Like many other batteries, the lithium-ion cells that power most electric vehicles rely on raw materials — like cobalt, lithium and rare earth elements — that have been linked to grave environmental and human rights concerns. Cobalt has been especially problematic. Mining cobalt produces hazardous tailings and slags that canleach into the environment, and studies have found highexposure in nearby communities, especially among children, to cobalt and other metals. Extracting the metals from their ores also requires a process called smelting, which can emit sulfur oxide and other harmful air pollution. And as much as 70 percent of the world’s cobalt supply is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a substantial proportion in unregulated “artisanal” mines where workers — including many children — dig the metal from the earth using only hand tools at great risk to their health and safety, human rights groups warn. The world’s lithium is either mined in Australia or from salt flats in the Andean regions of Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, operations thatuse large amounts of groundwaterto pump out the brines, drawing down the water available to Indigenous farmers and herders. The water required for producing batteries has meant that manufacturing electric vehicles isabout 50 percent more water intensivethan traditional internal combustion engines. Deposits of rare earths, concentrated in China, oftencontain radioactive substancesthat can emit radioactive water and dust. Focusing first on cobalt, automakers and other manufacturers have committed to eliminating “artisanal” cobalt from their supply chains, and have also said they will develop batteries that decrease, or do away with, cobalt altogether. But that technology is still in development, and the prevalence of these mines means these commitments “aren’t realistic,” said Mickaël Daudin of Pact, a nonprofit organization that works with mining communities in Africa. Instead, Mr. Daudin said, manufacturers need to work with these mines to lessen their environmental footprint and make sure miners are working in safe conditions. If companies acted responsibly, the rise of electric vehicles would be a great opportunity for countries like Congo, he said. But if they don’t, “they will put the environment, and many, many miners’ lives at risk.” As earlier generations of electric vehicles start to reach the end of their lives, preventing a pileup of spent batteries looms as a challenge. Most of today’s electric vehicles use lithium-ion batteries, which can store more energy in the same space than older, more commonly-used lead-acid battery technology. But while 99 percent of lead-acid batteriesare recycled in the United States, estimated recycling rates for lithium-ion batteriesare about 5 percent. Experts point out that spent batteries contain valuable metals and other materials that can be recovered and reused. Depending on the process used, battery recycling can also use large amounts of water, or emit air pollutants. “The percentage of lithium batteries being recycled is very low, but with time and innovation, that’s going to increase,” said Radenka Maric, a professor at the University of Connecticut’s Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. A different, promising approach to tackling used electric vehicle batteries is finding them a second life in storage and other applications. “For cars, when the battery goes below say 80 percent of its capacity, the range is reduced,” said Amol Phadke, a senior scientist at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley. “But that’s not a constraint for stationary storage.” Various automakers, including Nissan and BMW, have piloted the use of old electric vehicle batteries for grid storage. General Motors has said it designed its battery packs with second-life use in mind. But there are challenges: Reusing lithium-ion batteries requires extensive testing and upgrades to make sure they perform reliably. If done properly, though, used car batteries could continue to beused for a decade or moreas backup storage for solar power, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found in a study last year.

11,"Electric Cars Are Better for the Planet – and Often Your Budget, Too","Advertisement ByVeronica PenneyJan. 15, 2021 Electric vehicles are better for the climate than gas-powered cars, but many Americans are still reluctant to buy them. One reason: The larger upfront cost. New data published Thursday shows that despite the higher sticker price, electric cars may actually save drivers money in the long-run. To reach this conclusion, a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology calculated both the carbon dioxide emissions and full lifetime cost — including purchase price, maintenance and fuel — for nearly every new car model on the market. They found electric cars were easily more climate friendly than gas-burning ones. Over a lifetime, they were often cheaper, too. Average carbon dioxide emissions per mile 800 grams Toyota Sequoia Lexus GX 600 Diesel cars Traditional gas-powered carsspan a range of prices and emissions. 400 Hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehiclesare about the same price as traditional cars, but cut emissions roughly in half.

In the United States, the transportation sector is the largest source of emissions,most of which come from cars and trucks. Jessika Trancik, an associate professor of energy studies at M.I.T. who led the research, said she hoped the data would “help people learn about how those upfront costs are spread over the lifetime of the car.” For electric cars, lower maintenance costs and the lower costs of charging compared with gasoline prices tend to offset the higher upfront price over time. (Battery-electric engines have fewer moving parts that can break compared with gas-powered engines and they don’t require oil changes. Electric vehicles also use regenerative braking, which reduces wear and tear.) The cars are greener over time, too, despite the more emissions-intensive battery manufacturing process. Dr. Trancik estimates that an electric vehicle’s production emissions would be offset in anywhere from six to 18 months, depending on how clean the energy grid is where the car is charging. The new data showed hybrid cars, which run on a combination of fuel and battery power, and can sometimes be plugged in, had more mixed results for both emissions and costs. Some hybrids were cheaper and spewed less planet-warming carbon dioxide than regular cars, but others were in the same emissions and cost range as gas-only vehicles. Traditional gas-burning cars were usually the least climate friendly option, though long-term costs and emissions spanned a wide range. Compact cars were usually cheaper and more efficient, while gas-powered SUVs and luxury sedans landed on the opposite end of the spectrum. Dr. Trancik’s team released the data in aninteractive online toolto help people quantify the true costs of their car-buying decisions — both for the planet and their budget. The new estimates update astudypublished in 2016 and add to a growing body of research underscoring the potential lifetime savings of electric cars. Comparing individual cars can be useful — and sometimes surprising.

The M.I.T. team estimated the lifetime cost of the most basic model as comparable to a Nissan Altima that sells for $11,000 less upfront. (That’s even though Tesla’s federal tax incentive for electric vehicles has ended.) Toyota’s Hybrid RAV4 S.U.V. also ends up cheaper in the long run than a similar traditional RAV4, a national bestseller, despite a higher retail price. The charts above use nationwide average prices for gasoline and electricity to estimate lifetime costs, but the results may shift depending on where potential buyers live. (The interactive tool allows users to input their local rates.) Hawaii, Alaska and parts of New England have some of thehighestaverage electricity costs, while parts of the Midwest, West and South tend to have lower rates. Gas prices are lower along the Gulf Coast and higher in California. But ananalysis from the Union of Concerned Scientistsstill found that charging a vehicle was more cost effective than filling up at the pump across 50 major American cities. “We saw potential savings everywhere,” said David Reichmuth, a senior engineer for the group’s Clean Transportation Program. Still, the upfront cost of an electric vehicle continues to be a barrier for many would-be owners. The federal government offers a tax credit for some new electric vehicle purchases, but that does nothing to reduce the initial purchase price and does not apply to used cars. That means it disproportionately benefits wealthier Americans. Some states, like California, offer additional incentives. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. haspledgedto offer rebates that help consumers swap inefficient, old cars for cleaner new ones, and to create 500,000 more electric vehicle charging stations, too. Chris Gearhart, director of the Center for Integrated Mobility Sciences at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, said electric cars will become more price competitive in coming years as battery prices drop. At the same time, new technologies to reduce exhaust emissions are making traditional cars more expensive. “With that trajectory, you can imagine that even immediately at the purchase price level, certain smaller sedans could reach purchase price parity in the next couple of years,” Dr. Gearhart said.

12,How Electrifying Everything Became a Key Climate Solution,"Advertisement ByNadja PopovichandBrad PlumerApril 14, 2023 How electrification became a major tool for fighting climate change. A key part of America’s plan to slash carbon emissions: Plug incars and trucks. The United States still gets most of its energy by setting millions of tiny fires everywhere. Cars, trucks, homes and factories all burn fossil fuels in countless engines, furnaces and boilers, creating pollution that heats the planet. To tackle climate change, those machines will need to stop polluting. And the best way to do that, experts increasingly say, is to replace them with electric versions — cars, heating systems and factories that run on clean sources of electricity like wind, solar or nuclear power. But electrifying almost everything is a formidable task.

Here’s how muchof that energy comes from electricity.Electricity as a percent of total energy consumed in 2021 Transforming the economy so that more things run on clean electricity is a cornerstone of President Biden’splan to slash emissionsto nearly zero by 2050. The New York Times used data fromEvolved Energy Research, an energy modeling firm, to visualize what the nation’s energy use might look like in 2050 if the United States were able to meet the president’s climate change goals, using technology available today or just over the horizon, while minimizing costs. In this future, far more of America’s energy would come from electricity. The country would also use less energy overall, since electric devices are often more efficient than ones that burn fossil fuels. For example, a gasoline-powered car uses onlyabout 30 percentof the energy in its fuel to move its wheels, with most of the rest wasted as heat. An electric car uses about 80 percent of its energy.

Sales of electric vehiclesbroke recordslast year, accounting for 5.8 percent of new cars sold, and the administration has proposed regulations to ensure they make up two-thirds of sales by 2032. Electric heat pumpsoutsold gas furnacesfor the first time last year. Anew climate lawis providing billions of dollars in subsidies to hasten the transition. Plugging in isn’t the only way to cut emissions. Other options include clean hydrogen fuels, biofuels or technologies that capture pollution from the air, smokestacks or machines. But for many activities, the most straightforward solution is to go electric. “If you ask, ‘How on Earth are we going to power the modern economy cleanly,’ nothing else makes sense,” said Saul Griffith, founder and chief scientist of Rewiring America, an advocacy group. “All roads point to electrification.” Still, widespread electrification faces huge obstacles. It would mean replacing more than 280 million gasoline-powered cars and 200 million home appliances that run on natural gas such as furnaces, water heaters, stoves and dryers. Many Americans might balk at switching due to costs, logistics or a simple lack of interest. And some activities, such as long-haul trucking or chemical manufacturing, are difficult to electrify. It’s also not enough to shift to electric machines if their electricity comes from power plants that burn fossil fuels. Power plant emissionshave declined 40 percentsince 2005 as cheaper and cleaner gas, wind and solar energy sources have replaced coal. But much of the nation’s electricity is still generated by burning gas and coal, andit is getting harderto build and connect new sources of renewable power to antiquated grids. “There are people who say this is impossible, and people who say this isn’t challenging at all,” said Ben Haley, an energy expert and co-founder of Evolved Energy Research. “I’d say it’s somewhere in between: It’s challenging, but it’s not impossible.” Current Electricity Use 2050 Net Zero Pathway Electricity as percent of total energy consumed in 2021 Electricity as percent of total energy consumed in a high-electrification scenario Medium-duty trucks Heavy-duty trucks Buses and rail Other Heavy-duty trucks Shipping 2% < 0.1% Buses and rail Shipping Medium-duty trucks Passenger vehicles 89% electric Passenger vehicles Aviation <1% electric Aviation Other Less total energy use in2050 2021 Current Electricity Use Electricity as percent of total energy consumed in 2021 Heavy-duty trucks Buses and rail Other 2% <0.1% Medium- duty trucks Shipping Passenger vehicles <1% electric Aviation 0% 2050 Net Zero Pathway Electricity as percent of total energy consumed in a high-electrification scenario Medium-duty trucks Heavy-duty trucks Shipping Buses and rail Passenger vehicles 89% electric Aviation Other Less total energy use in2050 2021 America’s transportation system, which includes everything from cars to boats to airplanes, still runs almost entirely on fuels derived from oil. Only a tiny fraction of cars and trucks today are electric. Passenger vehicles are widely considered the most feasible to electrify as battery-powered cars, S.U.V.s and pickup trucks enter the mainstream, thoughhigh costs and the availability of charging stationsremain major hurdles. By contrast, heavy-duty trucks that carry goods thousands of miles cross-countrycould prove harder to electrify, particularly if they require large batteries that take hours to charge. Some truck makers like Daimler and Volvo have said that a better alternative would be hydrogen fuel made from wind or solar power, though that would require extensive new infrastructure to make and distribute all that hydrogen. “Batteries are in the lead right now, especially since we already have a charging network being built,” said Tom Walker, the transportation technology manager at Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit environmental group. “But it’s not clear that electrification will make the most sense everywhere, so we should keep our options open.” Aviation is even tougher. Today’s batteries are too bulky to power all but the smallest planes. For longer flights and bigger jets, airlines mayneed other options, such as fuels made from agricultural waste or more elaborate fuels that recycle carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which are still extremely costly.

Cooking Cooking Less total energy use in2050 2021 Most homes and businesses already use electricity to power air-conditioners, lights, refrigerators and other appliances. But millions of buildings also burn fossil fuels, mainly natural gas or fuel oil, to power furnaces, hot water heaters, stoves, ovens and clothes dryers, together producing 13 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Electric alternatives already exist for most gas appliances. Electric heat pumps, for instance, essentially act as two-way air-conditioners that can provide cooling in the summer and heating in the winter. Heat pump technologyhas steadily improvedin recent years, with many models able to operate efficiently in subzero temperatures. But for many single-family homes or apartment buildings, the economics of switching from gas to electric heatmay be forbidding, since natural gas is cheap. Some homes require costly upgrades to electric panels, or new ductwork. And while last year’s climate law offers subsidies for electric appliances, many contractors are still unfamiliar with heat pumps andelectricians are in short supply. The gas industryhas also fought hardagainst electrification policies. “Every home is different and the costs of electrification can vary pretty widely,” said Ryan Jones, a co-founder of Evolved Energy. Another potential challenge: Many electric grids today are set up to deal with power demand peaking in the summer, when air-conditioners run full blast. But if electric heating becomes widespread, utilities will have to figure out how to handlesurging demand in the winter— when, incidentally, there is less solar power available. (Currently, utilities stockpile vast quantities of natural gas underground for wintertime, which is much tougher to do with electricity.)

Today, much of this heat is created by burning natural gas or coal. In theory, many companies could instead generate heat using electricity. Onerecent studyby Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that about half of industrial energy use had “high” or “medium” potential for electrification, including production of aluminum, machinery, wood, rubber and some plastics. But that is oftensignificantly more expensivethan generating heat by burning natural gas. Other industrial processesare trickier to electrify. Cement kilns and glass manufacturers, for instance, often need temperatures in excess of 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. The chemical industry, a major source of emissions, often uses fossil fuels as a raw material for its products, with no easy substitute. Perhaps the biggest hurdle to electrifying industry is the lack of incentives. While the government offers tax credits for electric cars and home heat pumps, it has largely ignored the industrial sector, whose energy use is expected to keep growing in the coming decades. Many companies are wary of testing out new processes without government support. “If we just waited around for another century, industry would probably move to electrification on its own, because it’s more efficient than burning things for heat,” said Chris Bataille, a research fellow at the Columbia Center on Global Energy Policy. “But that’s obviously not fast enough to meet our climate goals.” Electrification would require sweeping changes to the nation’s power grids. Under the scenario visualized above, total electricity demand in the United States would roughly double by 2050, even as overall energy use went down. To meet that demand, electric utilities would need to add staggering amounts of new emissions-free power while making sure that all those newly electrified cars, homes and factories don’t strain the system and cause blackouts. They would also have to construct large new power lines across the country, both to accommodate far-flung renewable projects and to improve the reliability of the grid. Yet transmission projects have become notoriously hard to build. And some expertshave warnedthat the clean energy transition will falter without them. “If we’re going to rely on the grid for so much more of our daily life, then we better start planning now to make sure it’s a lot more resilient than it is today,” said Susan Tierney, an energy consultant with the Analysis Group. It’s not a small concern. Last summer, amid a severe heat wave and electricity crunch, Californiaasked residentsto avoid charging their electric cars during peak hours. That raised questions about whether the grid could handle a surge of new demand at a time when climate change is already fueling extreme weather. There are potential solutions. Utilities, for instance,could get better at schedulingwhen electric vehicles and other appliances are charged, so that they don’t all power up at the same time and strain equipment or require the construction of costly new power plants. More battery storage could help, too. Even so, some experts remain skeptical. “To assume this will be the world we live in, in a few decades, is premature,” said David Rapson, an economist at the University of California, Davis. He has said that rigid electric vehicle mandates such as thoseby Californiaorthe Biden administrationmay be too aggressive, potentially driving up costs and stifling other climate solutions. Others point out that electrifying everything — or at least most things — will have broad benefits, including deep cuts in air pollution. Matteo Muratori, an analyst at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, likened the transition from fossil fuels to electric to “going from analog to digital.” “There’s a lot more you can do with electricity as a fuel,” he said, “more efficiency, less waste, avoiding pollution — it’s not just about greenhouse gases.” Data notes:Projections for U.S. energy consumption in 2050 are based on the “central” scenario in modeling by Evolved Energy Research. It reflects one potential pathway to net-zero emissions by mid-century that includes high rates of electrification. If, however, electrifying the economy proves more difficult than expected, the researchers have laid out other net-zero scenarios that make greater use of other technologies such as hydrogen or biofuels but that also cost more. More information about Evolved Energy Research’s modeling is available in its2022 ADP report.Current U.S. energy and electricity consumption is based on data from the Energy Information Administration’s 2022 Annual Energy Outlook that has been modified by Evolved Energy Research. It reflects only energy consumed by end users and doesn’t include upstream uses, such as energy used to extract fossil fuels or refine oil into gasoline. For some sectors, such as chemicals, energy includes both fossil fuels that are burned for heat and power as well as fossil fuels that are used as feedstocks for industrial processes.In this analysis, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles aren’t counted as “electric” vehicles, and the air-conditioning category for commercial buildings includes ventilation.

13,"Electric Cars Too Costly for Many, Even With Aid in Climate Bill","Advertisement Supported by Battery-powered vehicles are considered essential to the fight against climate change, but most models are aimed at the affluent. ByJack Ewing Policymakers in Washington are promoting electric vehicles as a solution to climate change. But an uncomfortable truth remains: Battery-powered cars are much too expensive for a vast majority of Americans. Congress has begun trying to address that problem. Theclimate and energy package passed on Sunday by the Senate, the Inflation Reduction Act, would give buyers of used electric cars a tax credit. But automakers have complained that the credit would apply to only a narrow slice of vehicles, at least initially, largely because of domestic sourcing requirements. And experts say broader steps are needed to make electric cars more affordable and to get enough of them on the road to put a serious dent in greenhouse gas emissions. High prices are caused by shortages of batteries, of raw materials like lithium and of components like semiconductors. Strong demand for electric vehicles from affluent buyers means that carmakers have little incentive to sell cheaper models. For low- and middle-income people who don’t have their own garages or driveways, another obstacle is the lack of enough public facilities to recharge. The bottlenecks will take years to unclog. Carmakers and suppliers of batteries and chips must build and equip new factories. Commodity suppliers have to open new mines and build refineries. Charging companies are struggling to install stations fast enough. In the meantime, electric vehicles remain largely the province of the rich. To some extent, the carmakers are following their usual game plan. They have always introduced new technology at a luxury price. With time, the features and gadgets make their way into cheaper cars. But emission-free technology has an urgency that voice navigation or massaging seats did not. Transportation accounts for 27 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Battery-powered cars produce far less carbon dioxide than vehicles that run on gasoline or diesel. That’s true even accounting for the emissions from generating electricity and from manufacturing batteries, according to numerous studies. Only a few years ago analysts were predicting that electric vehicles would soon be as cheap to buy as gasoline cars. Given the savings on fuel and maintenance, going electric would be a no-brainer. Instead, soaring prices of commodities like lithium, an essential ingredient in batteries, helped raise the average sticker price of an electric vehicle 14 percent last year to $66,000, $20,000 more than the average for all new cars, according to Kelley Blue Book. Demand for electric vehicles is so strong that models like the Ford Mach-E are effectively sold out, and there are long waits for others. Tesla’s website informs buyers that they can’t expect delivery of a Model Y, with a purchase price of $66,000, until sometime between January and April. With so much demand, carmakers have little reason to target budget-minded buyers. Economy car stalwarts like Toyota and Honda are not yet selling significant numbers of all-electric models in the United States. Scarcity has been good for Ford, Mercedes-Benz and other carmakers that are selling fewer cars than before the pandemic but recording fat profits. Automakers are “not giving any more discounts because demand is higher than the supply,” said Axel Schmidt, a senior managing director at Accenture who oversees the consulting firm’s automotive division. “The general trend currently is no one is interested in low prices.” Advertised prices for electric vehicles tend to start around $40,000, not including a federal tax credit of $7,500. Good luck finding an electric car at that semi-affordable price. Ford has stopped taking orders for Lightning electric pickups, with an advertised starting price of about $40,000, because it can’t make them fast enough. Hyundai advertises that its electric Ioniq 5 starts at about $40,000. But the cheapest models available from dealers in the New York area, based on a search of the company’s website, were around $49,000 before taxes. Tesla’s Model 3, which the company began producing in 2017, was supposed to be an electric car for average folks, with a base price of $35,000. But Tesla has since raised the price for the cheapest version to $47,000. Even used electric cars are scarce. Popular models like the Tesla Y and Ford Mach-E are sometimes selling for thousands of dollars more used than they did new. Buyers are willing to pay a premium to get an electric car, even a used one, right away. Joshua Berliner, a Los Angeles entrepreneur, was in the market for a used Model 3 sedan but discovered that prices were higher than for a new Tesla. “The same held true for nearly every make we looked at,” Mr. Berliner said in an email. Mr. Berliner, who owns a Tesla and wanted a second one for his wife, said he had become so desperate that he almost bought a gasoline car. “I normally wouldn’t consider combustion vehicles, but if gas prices were lower I might have pulled the trigger,” he said. The Inflation Reduction Act, which appears likely topass the House, would give buyers of used cars a tax credit of up to $4,000. The used-car market is twice the size of the new-car market and is where most people get their rides. But the tax credit for used cars would apply only to those sold for $25,000 or less. Less than 20 percent of used electric vehicles fit that category, said Scott Case, chief executive of Recurrent, a research firm focused on the used-vehicle market. The supply of secondhand vehicles will grow over time, Mr. Case said. He noted that the Model 3, which has sold more than any other electric car, became widely available only in 2018. New-car buyers typically keep their vehicles three or four years before trading them in. A $7,500 credit for new electric vehicles, another provision of the Inflation Reduction Act, would help push down prices across the board and filter down to the used-car market, Mr. Case said. Carmakers sold nearly 200,000 new electric vehicles in the United States from April through June. As those new cars age, used electric vehicles will become “accessible to a lot more people,” Mr. Case said. The problem is that many new electric cars may not qualify for the $7,500 credits. The Inflation Reduction Act sets standards for how much of a car’s battery must be made in North America with raw materials from trade allies. Several car manufacturers and suppliers have announced plans to build battery factories in the United States, but few have begun producing. “Right now with our lack of capacity for materials, I don’t think there is any product that will meet that today,” Carla Bailo, president of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich., said of the standards. “Tesla is probably close, but the rest of the manufacturers, no way.” The legislation also excludes imported electric vehicles from the tax credit. The provision is designed to protect American jobs but would undercut the price advantage of Chinese brands that are expected to enter the United States.SAIC’s MG unitsells an electric S.U.V. in Europe for about $31,000 before incentives. New battery designsoffer hope for cheaper electric cars but will take years to appear in lower-priced models. Predictably, next-generation batteries that charge faster and go farther are likely to appear first in luxury cars, like those from Porsche and Mercedes. Companies working on these advanced technologies argue that they will ultimately reduce costs for everyone by packing more energy into smaller packages. A smaller battery saves weight and cuts the cost of cooling systems, brakes and other components because they can be designed for a lighter car. “You can actually decrease everything else,” said Justin Mirro, chief executive of Kensington Capital Acquisition, which helped the battery maker QuantumScape go public and is preparing a stock market listing for the fledgling battery maker Amprius Technologies. “It just has this multiplier effect.” The Department of Energy is trying to encourage start-ups to focus more on batteries for the masses. In May the department offered$45 millionin grants to firms or researchers working on batteries that, among other things, would last longer, to create a bigger supply of used vehicles. “We also need cheaper batteries, and batteries that charge faster and work better in the winter,” said Halle Cheeseman, a program director who focuses on batteries at the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, part of the Department of Energy. Gene Berdichevsky, chief executive of Sila Nanotechnologies, a California company working on next-generation battery technology, argues that prices are following a curve like the one solar cells did. Prices for solar panels ticked up when demand began to take off, but soon resumed a steady decline. The first car to use Sila’s technology will be a Mercedes luxury S.U.V. But Mr. Berdichevsky said: “I’m not in this to make toys for the rich. I’m here to make all cars go electric.” A few manufacturers offer cars aimed at the less wealthy. A Chevrolet Bolt, a utilitarian hatchback, lists for $25,600 before incentives. Volkswagen said this month that the entry-level version of its 2023 ID.4 electric sport utility vehicle, which the German carmaker has begun manufacturing at its factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., will start at $37,500, or around $30,000 if it qualifies for the federal tax credit. Then there is the Wuling Hongguang Mini EV, produced in China by a joint venture of General Motors and the Chinese automakers SAIC and Wuling. The car reportedly outsells the Tesla Model 3 in China. While the $4,500 price tag is unbeatable, it is unlikely that many Americans would buy a car with a top speed of barely 60 miles per hour and a range slightly over 100 miles. There is no sign that the car will be exported to the United States. Eventually, Ms. Bailo of the Center for Automotive Research said, carmakers will run out of well-heeled buyers and aim at the other 95 percent. “They listen to their customers,” she said. “Eventually that demand from high-income earners is going to abate.” Jack Ewingwrites about business from New York, focusing on the auto industry and the transition to electric cars.

14,Automakers Delay Electric Vehicle Spending as Demand Slows,"Advertisement Supported by Growth is brisk but slower than expected, causing automakers to question their multibillion-dollar investments in new factories and raising doubts about the effectiveness of federal incentives. ByJack Ewing Normally a 50 percent increase in sales is considered very good. But when the number of electric vehicles sold in the United States grew that much during the third quarter from a year earlier, it was a disappointment. Carmakers and analysts had expected more. Instead of celebrating, auto executives worried that demand for electric vehicles was slackening, raising questions about their plans to invest tens of billions of dollars to develop new models and build factories. In recent weeks, General Motors, Ford Motor and Tesla cited slower sales and signs that the economy was weakening in announcing that they would delay that spending. That was a blow to the Biden administration’s plan to fight climate change by promoting zero-emission vehicles, and it cast doubt on whether generous federal tax credits for electric car buyers were working as well as policymakers had hoped. “Our commitment to an all-E.V. future is as strong as ever,” Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of G.M., told analysts on a conference call last month. But, she added, the market is turning out to be “a bit bumpy.” As a result, G.M. is waiting several months to begin selling some new electric models, including a battery-powered incarnation of the Chevrolet Equinox sport utility vehicle. Ford and G.M. have staked billions to retool factories and build new ones to produce electric vehicles, batteries and other components. If the carmakers have miscalculated, the consequences could be severe. (Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram, has not yet begun selling any all-electric vehicles in the United States.) Sales of electric vehicles in China and Europe are also growing more slowly than they were a few months ago. Still, electric vehicle sales are growing faster than any other major category of automobile, and Americans will buy more than one million of them this year, a record. From July through September, battery-powered cars accounted for 8 percent of the new cars sold in the United States, up from 6 percent a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive. But some once-hot models are selling more slowly. Sales of the Ford Mustang Mach-E, which commanded a stiff markup a year ago, slumped 10 percent in October from a year earlier, Ford said last week. “E.V.s are still in high demand,” Jim Farley, Ford’s chief executive, told analysts. But he added that increased competition had pushed down prices. Carmakers have introduced at least 14 new all-electric models in the last year, according to Cox, and stepped up production of other models that had been in short supply. Inevitably, some sell better than others. “The demand is inching up, but it’s not moving up nearly to the degree that supply and production is increasing,” said Rob Cochran, chief executive of #1 Cochran Automotive, which owns 34 dealerships in Pennsylvania and Ohio that sell nearly all major brands, including Ford, Chevrolet, Hyundai and Volkswagen. EvenTesla— which dominates the electric car market, with about half of all sales in the most recent quarter — has struggled to sell cars and had to cut prices by thousands of dollars. Some conservatives have seized on recent data to argue that electric vehicles are overhyped. Republicans like Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio have claimed electric vehicles are destroying auto industry jobs, and have proposed rolling back policies designed to encourage people to buy battery-powered cars. A political agenda is driving some of those proclaiming an end to the electric vehicle boom, said Albert Gore III, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, an industry group whose members include carmakers like Tesla and Rivian, charging companies like EVgo and ChargePoint, and suppliers of equipment and raw materials. “There are a lot of folks eager to draw a conclusion we should be less aggressive with policy,” Mr. Gore said. Some analysts said the uneven growth was not surprising as electric vehicles go from being a niche product to a more mass market offering. Most car owners are still learning about the technology, and carmakers and dealers are figuring out how best to sell to them. “We had a lot of early adopters buy expensive electric vehicles,” said Tom Narayan, global autos analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “Now you’re at the point where the Main Street consumer is looking at E.V.s.” Ford illustrates the mixed signals that sales figures are sending. While sales of the Mach-E were up just 1.5 percent in the first 10 months of the year, sales of the F-150 Lightning, a battery-powered pickup, surged 43 percent. All told, sales of Ford electric vehicles rose 13 percent from January through October while sales of cars and trucks with internal combustion engines were up 7 percent. Sales of hybrid vehicles, which combine electric propulsion with internal combustion engines, climbed 19 percent. The weak Mach-E sales probably reflect competition from the Tesla Model Y more than any broader trend, analysts said. Many buyers might be comparing the two vehicles, which are of a similar size and style. Tesla has cut the price of the Model Y so that the least expensive model is $2,500 less than the Ford after federal tax credits are applied. The end of theUnited Automobile Workers’ recent strikesagainst Ford, G.M. and Stellantis has refocused attention on traditional carmakers’ attempts to compete with Tesla. Electric vehicles played an important role in the U.A.W. negotiations, and tentative contract agreements extend at least some union privileges to workers at new battery factories. But the deals will increase manufacturing costs and make it that much harder for Ford, G.M. and Stellantis to catch up to Tesla, which is not unionized. Buyers remain interested in electric vehicles, surveys show, but struggle to afford them. The average price paid for an electric vehicle in the United States was less than $51,000 in September, according to Cox Automotive. That’s a huge decline from last year’s $65,000. But it’s still too high for many new-car buyers, especially as high interest rates have made monthly car payments more expensive. The average rate on a car loan is more than 8 percent, according to Federal Reserve data, compared with less than 5 percent in early 2022. In the last few years, carmakers flooded the market with S.U.V.s aimed at affluent suburban homeowners. And there is still a dearth of cars priced below $30,000 that middle-class buyers can afford. “A lot of automakers were rushing vehicles into the market,” said Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights and analytics at CarGurus, an online car marketplace. “Now they’re running into a situation in a rising interest rate environment that they are not priced properly.” Some would-be electric vehicle buyers may also be worried about finding enough places to quickly charge cars on road trips. After price, charging infrastructure is the No. 1 thing people worry about when considering an E.V., many surveys conclude. Public charging is also essential for anyone who lives in an apartment or can’t install a home charger, a group that skews young. “The younger demographic is more open to electric vehicles than the older demographic,” Mr. Cochran, the Ohio and Pennsylvania dealer, said. “Typically it’s the younger demographic that’s in apartment settings. The fact that the infrastructure is not built up is a deterrent.” At least two of Mr. Cochran’s customers returned newly purchased electric vehicles after discovering there weren’t enough chargers near their homes, he said. For people interested in buying an electric vehicle, the good news is that prices are likely to continue falling as carmakers ramp up new factories. Starting in January, dealers will be able to apply federal tax credits of up to $7,500 when a customer buys a car. Previously, buyers had to wait until they filed their taxes to claim the credit. The charging system is also improving, albeit slowly. Parts of Tesla’s network of fast chargers, the largest in the United States, will open to Ford, G.M. and other brands next year. Other carmakers are building their own chargers. Mercedes-Benz said last week that it would install at least 55 stations at high-end shopping malls in the United States and Canada operated by Simon Property Group, a large real estate firm. Carmakers have gotten the message that selling electric vehicles is different from selling gasoline cars. “Charging,” said Andrew Cornelia, chief executive of Mercedes’s high-power charging unit in North America, “is still a critical problem to solve.” Jack Ewingwrites about the auto industry with an emphasis on electric vehicles.More about Jack Ewing
