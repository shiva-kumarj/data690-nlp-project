That prompted howls of “I told you so” from those who think the electrification of everything from home appliances to cars is a left-wing pipe dream, especially in light of California’s mandate requiring 100% of all new vehicle sales to be zero-emission by 2035.', 'Nor am I part of the problem because of the worries expressed ad nauseum by EV skeptics, few of which have much merit.', 'Yes, driving distance is an issue, but only for a tiny percentage of trips.', 'Yes, my electricity bill is higher, but the additional cost is far lower than what drivers pay for gas.', 'Yes, apartment and condo dwellers who cannot plug in at night have legitimate concerns, because they must rely on our public charging infrastructure — which is growing.', 'Yes, EVs have a carbon footprint, but still typically much smaller than those of gas cars. On this, the evidence is so compelling that it’s hard to imagine survival on this planet unless we immediately replace gas-powered autos with electric ones. Consequently, if the state and federal governments want to take meaningful action on climate change, they have no choice but to subsidize EV buyers.', 'And that’s part of the problem. In the end, an electric car is still, well, a car — and mass car ownership has devastating environmental consequences beyond tailpipe emissions.', 'I became part of this car culture in 2018, after The Times moved from downtown L.A. to El Segundo. Until then I was a dedicated transit commuter and even held out for months after The Times’ relocation. But five hours a day on buses and trains eventually got to me, so I leased a Nissan Leaf.', 'Then a funny thing happened: Some well-meaning people reacted as if I had done the world a favor. Never mind the loss of a transit user to 60-mile daily drives — I had become an EV operator, once pitied for bus riding, now praised for driving.', 'But electric vehicles, like gas-powered cars, require vast expanses of concrete and asphalt for automotive use. This paving over of entire regions has turned neighborhoods into heat sinks that soak up energy from the sun during the day and release it at night — not exactly what we want in an era of accelerating climate change.', 'And electric vehicles, like gas-powered cars, force their drivers to sit in the same traffic jams as everyone else, often on freeways that required the bulldozing of long-established, minority communities to be built. In Downey, locals are fighting a highway expansion plan that would displace residents from more than 200 homes. I haven’t asked, but something tells me “yeah, but more electric cars” wouldn’t convince those residents to give up fighting for their homes.', 'And electric vehicles, like gas-powered cars, needlessly kill people. In the city of Los Angeles, a record 294 people were killed in traffic in 2021. Inadequate infrastructure is largely to blame, but so is the increasing size of cars — and electric cars are getting bigger too, to make them more appealing to American consumers.', 'This isn’t to say there aren’t benefits to replacing dirty vehicles with zero-emission ones. Cities need to curb air pollution, and electric cars cause very little of it. Children living near freeways have higher rates of asthma, and trading internal combustion engines for electric motors would certainly help them.', 'But replacing one kind of car for another isn’t enough if cities like Los Angeles want to be anything other than traffic-choked dystopias. Right now, subsidizing EV ownership to the tune of nearly $10,000 off a car’s sticker price (in California) may be necessary to reduce the acceleration of climate change, but it’s also just a Band-Aid to buy time for systemic change to take hold.', 'And what kind of systemic change would that be? Build out a big public transit system (L.A. is trying), and make it free, reliable and safe. Subsidize the purchase of electric bikes, which make it easier to commute longer distances on devices that use considerably less power and road space than electric cars. Think more of what people in neighborhoods need than what people driving through those neighborhoods want.', 'And for the love of God, shelter every bus stop on every block, so riders don’t risk sunstroke when they take transit during a heat wave.']",latimes,west-coast,started driving electric vehicle 2018 became part problem reasons cited ev critics recent heat wave state asked electric cars charged peak demand prompted howls told think electrification everything home appliances cars leftwing pipe dream especially light californias mandate requiring 100 new vehicle sales zeroemission 2035 part problem worries expressed ad nauseum ev skeptics much merit yes driving distance issue tiny percentage trips yes electricity bill higher additional cost far lower drivers pay gas yes apartment condo dwellers plug night legitimate concerns must rely public charging infrastructure growing yes evs carbon footprint still typically much smaller gas cars evidence compelling hard imagine survival planet unless immediately replace gaspowered autos electric ones consequently state federal governments want take meaningful action climate change choice subsidize ev buyers part problem end electric car still well car mass car ownership devastating environmental consequences beyond tailpipe emissions became part car culture 2018 times moved downtown la el segundo dedicated transit commuter even held months times relocation five hours day buses trains eventually got leased nissan leaf funny thing happened wellmeaning people reacted done world favor never mind loss transit user 60mile daily drives become ev operator pitied bus riding praised driving electric vehicles like gaspowered cars require vast expanses concrete asphalt automotive use paving entire regions turned neighborhoods heat sinks soak energy sun day release night exactly want era accelerating climate change electric vehicles like gaspowered cars force drivers sit traffic jams everyone else often freeways required bulldozing longestablished minority communities built downey locals fighting highway expansion plan would displace residents 200 homes asked something tells yeah electric cars would convince residents give fighting homes electric vehicles like gaspowered cars needlessly kill people city los angeles record 294 people killed traffic 2021 inadequate infrastructure largely blame increasing size cars electric cars getting bigger make appealing american consumers say benefits replacing dirty vehicles zeroemission ones cities need curb air pollution electric cars little children living near freeways higher rates asthma trading internal combustion engines electric motors would certainly help replacing one kind car another enough cities like los angeles want anything trafficchoked dystopias right subsidizing ev ownership tune nearly 10000 cars sticker price california may necessary reduce acceleration climate change also bandaid buy time systemic change take hold kind systemic change would build big public transit system la trying make free reliable safe subsidize purchase electric bikes make easier commute longer distances devices use considerably less power road space electric cars think people neighborhoods need people driving neighborhoods want love god shelter every bus stop every block riders risk sunstroke take transit heat wave,09-17-2022,2022,"[('2018', 'DATE'), ('100', 'CARDINAL'), ('2035', 'DATE'), ('2018', 'DATE'), ('la el', 'GPE'), ('months', 'DATE'), ('five hours day', 'TIME'), ('nissan', 'ORG'), ('60mile', 'CARDINAL'), ('daily', 'DATE'), ('200', 'CARDINAL'), ('los angeles', 'GPE'), ('294', 'CARDINAL'), ('2021', 'CARDINAL'), ('american', 'NORP'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('los angeles', 'GPE'), ('nearly 10000', 'CARDINAL'), ('california', 'GPE')]"
1, Op-Ed: Think bigger. Switching to electric cars isn’t enough ,"['It might feel like the easy solution — just replace your gas-guzzling SUV with an electric SUV, and if everyone does that, eventually we’ll solve climate change. You can see why California regulators decided last month that by 2035, all new cars sold in the state must be electric. After all, car exhaust is the single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in California, so surely switching gas-powered cars to electric ones will make a huge dent in fighting climate change.', 'Except it doesn’t. For starters, electric cars still pollute. They don’t have tailpipe emissions, but the process of producing and transporting them creates pollution. According to the International Energy Agency, the average gas-powered car will create 41.9 tons of CO2 emissions from the point it’s manufactured until it’s retired, in contrast to 21.1 tons of CO2 from an EV. In other words, while the average EV will pollute about 50% less compared  with a gas-powered car, it’s still highly polluting.', 'There’s also pollution, and other harms, that come before the manufacturing stage, especially in the intensifying global competition to procure rare earth materials (concentrated in China) for EV batteries. In the past, we have often been dependent on the Middle East for oil. Do we want to create a future in which we’re again dependent on countries that may not be aligned with our values for required materials for our transportation system?', 'The second issue is power capacity. During the first week in September, California faced a historic heat wave, and alerts were issued asking EV owners to not charge their vehicles during peak times. And this is at a time when only 1.9% of cars operating in California are EVs. What happens when that number is 5%? Or 20%? Without a dramatic increase in power production from clean sources, it won’t be possible to supply power to all the EVs without ramping up use of coal and natural gas for electricity generation, increasing emissions from fossil fuels.', 'There are some bottom lines that are true whether cars are powered by fossil fuels or electricity:', 'Electric cars are just as dangerous for people outside the car; if you get hit by a 9,000-pound electric Hummer or a 7,000-pound gas Hummer, you’re dead either way. EVs are just as dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists as their gas-powered cousins, and rushing to adopt them without changing the way we use space on our streets is a recipe for a continued upward trend of pedestrian, cyclist and driver deaths.', 'Electric cars take up the same amount of space as gas-powered cars; even if we could wave a wand and convert every car on the road today to an EV, traffic would still be miserable, and the demand for driving and parking space would continue to suck the lifeblood out of our cities.', 'Additionally, car-based infrastructure is very expensive. In 1982, President Reagan signed a law that allocated 80% of the Highway Trust Fund to highways, and 20% to public transportation. This means the country built and maintains an extraordinarily expensive roadway network at the expense of quality high-speed trains and investments in other non-car infrastructure. In 2019, we spent $203 billion nationwide on highways and roads, and that amount is low compared to what is needed. (The highway trust fund doesn’t actually cover all the maintenance costs of highways, and we haven’t raised the federal gas tax since 1993.) ', 'If all cars were electric, we would still spend a disproportionate amount of money building and maintaining car infrastructure, with little left over to build world-class high-speed rail, bus or bike infrastructure inside and between our cities. We would still have outdated parking requirements for developers — which drive up the cost of housing and aggravate sprawl. And because EVs typically weigh more than their gas-powered counterparts, and heavier vehicles wear down the road faster, we will need to spend even more money on maintenance over the long term.', 'Electric cars aren’t a panacea to solve climate change. They can be part of the solution, but a myopic focus on electric cars as the solution prevents us from seeing so many other ideas. We need a future with fewer cars (electric or not) and much more public transit and bike usage. We need a complete rethink of how we use our public space, and better infrastructure so people can take short trips without using a car.', 'There are no shortcuts to solving climate change. We shouldn’t assume that once every gas-powered car is replaced with an electric one, we’ll solve the problem — because we won’t. We should instead put our energy into redoing how we use our road space, to truly curb pollution and needless death and bring life back into our cities.', 'Michael Schneider is the founder of Streets for All.']",latimes,west-coast,might feel like easy solution replace gasguzzling suv electric suv everyone eventually well solve climate change see california regulators decided last month 2035 new cars sold state must electric car exhaust single biggest source greenhouse gas emissions california surely switching gaspowered cars electric ones make huge dent fighting climate change except starters electric cars still pollute tailpipe emissions process producing transporting creates pollution according international energy agency average gaspowered car create 419 tons co2 emissions point manufactured retired contrast 211 tons co2 ev words average ev pollute 50 less compared gaspowered car still highly polluting also pollution harms come manufacturing stage especially intensifying global competition procure rare earth materials concentrated china ev batteries past often dependent middle east oil want create future dependent countries may aligned values required materials transportation system second issue power capacity first week september california faced historic heat wave alerts issued asking ev owners charge vehicles peak times time 19 cars operating california evs happens number 5 20 without dramatic increase power production clean sources possible supply power evs without ramping use coal natural gas electricity generation increasing emissions fossil fuels bottom lines true whether cars powered fossil fuels electricity electric cars dangerous people outside car get hit 9000pound electric hummer 7000pound gas hummer dead either way evs dangerous pedestrians cyclists gaspowered cousins rushing adopt without changing way use space streets recipe continued upward trend pedestrian cyclist driver deaths electric cars take amount space gaspowered cars even could wave wand convert every car road today ev traffic would still miserable demand driving parking space would continue suck lifeblood cities additionally carbased infrastructure expensive 1982 president reagan signed law allocated 80 highway trust fund highways 20 public transportation means country built maintains extraordinarily expensive roadway network expense quality highspeed trains investments noncar infrastructure 2019 spent 203 billion nationwide highways roads amount low compared needed highway trust fund actually cover maintenance costs highways raised federal gas tax since 1993 cars electric would still spend disproportionate amount money building maintaining car infrastructure little left build worldclass highspeed rail bus bike infrastructure inside cities would still outdated parking requirements developers drive cost housing aggravate sprawl evs typically weigh gaspowered counterparts heavier vehicles wear road faster need spend even money maintenance long term electric cars panacea solve climate change part solution myopic focus electric cars solution prevents us seeing many ideas need future fewer cars electric much public transit bike usage need complete rethink use public space better infrastructure people take short trips without using car shortcuts solving climate change assume every gaspowered car replaced electric one well solve problem instead put energy redoing use road space truly curb pollution needless death bring life back cities michael schneider founder streets,09-15-2022,2022,"[('california', 'GPE'), ('last month 2035', 'DATE'), ('california', 'GPE'), ('419 tons', 'QUANTITY'), ('co2', 'CARDINAL'), ('211 tons', 'QUANTITY'), ('50', 'CARDINAL'), ('china', 'GPE'), ('middle east', 'LOC'), ('second', 'ORDINAL'), ('first week', 'DATE'), ('september', 'DATE'), ('california', 'GPE'), ('19', 'CARDINAL'), ('california', 'GPE'), ('evs happens', 'PERSON'), ('number 5 20', 'CARDINAL'), ('9000pound', 'CARDINAL'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('1982', 'DATE'), ('reagan', 'PERSON'), ('80', 'CARDINAL'), ('20', 'CARDINAL'), ('2019', 'DATE'), ('203 billion', 'MONEY'), ('1993', 'DATE'), ('michael', 'PERSON')]"

If these ambitious new rules are enacted, the U.S. could make major progress in fighting climate change.', 'The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday released new pollution standards for passenger cars and trucks that would be the strongest vehicle emission regulations to date. To comply, automakers would have to significantly increase the number of electric vehicles they produce over the next decade.', 'That would be a huge change in the vehicle market, which has slowly been rolling out zero-emission models. Last year, about 6% of passenger cars and trucks sold were electric. The proposed emission limits are so strict, the EPA expects that about 67% of passenger vehicles sold by 2032 would be electric in order to meet the standards. ', ' Opinion ', 'Not many electric vehicles in the U.S. will be eligible for federal subsidies under Inflation Reduction Act guidelines due to battery and minerals sourcing restrictions.', 'April 5, 2023', 'The proposal would also transform the commercial sector,  in which there are now few electric models on the roads. By 2032, about half of new buses, garbage trucks and delivery vans sold would have to be electric, and  25% to 35% of new heavy-duty trucks would be zero-emission models. ', 'Swapping out that many combustion engines would slash planet-warming pollution from the transportation sector, which is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. The EPA projects the regulations would avoid putting into the atmosphere nearly 10 billion tons of carbon emissions, which is the equivalent of two times the total U.S. carbon emissions in 2022.', 'These vehicle pollution standards could be one of the  United States’ most important steps in staving off the most devastating effects of global warming and reducing exposure to unhealthful pollution — if the regulations are put into place. As of now, they are just proposals and need to go through a public comment period before the EPA adopts the regulations, which are expected to become final next year and begin to apply to 2027 model-year vehicles.

The rules would go further than Biden’s previous goal of having half of all cars sold in 2030 be electric.', ' Opinion ', 'U.N. climate report shows we can’t just phase out oil and gas; we have to deliberately dismantle existing infrastructure, such as coal plants in China and drilling in Alaska. ', 'March 21, 2023', 'There are legitimate questions about supply chain readiness, including the availability of materials used in battery manufacturing, which could drive up the price of EVs. There are also real worries about whether the U.S. will have the charging stations and electric grid capability to power all those new EVs. Cost and the lack of charging stations are key reasons why 60% of consumers said they are not likely to buy an electric car as their next vehicle, according to a recent survey.', 'Those are challenges that must be addressed more urgently. But that doesn’t mean the EPA should wait for all problems to be solved before pressing ahead with aggressive vehicle emissions standards. Regulations drive results, and the planet needs results quickly.', 'A United Nations report released last month warned the planet is on track to blow past 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, a critical threshold virtually every nation on Earth has agreed to work to avoid to prevent greater harm from climate change. To avoid that fate, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the world needs to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2035.', 'Reaching that requires transforming the transportation sector.

People who care and are involved in this conversation are going to be much wiser on how they protect the resources of Imperial Valley.”', 'Toward a more sustainable California', 'Get Boiling Point, our newsletter exploring climate change, energy and the environment, and become part of the conversation — and the solution.', ' You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.', 'Lithium is just one challenge. There are several other elements needed to build electric vehicle batteries that auto industry players warn could become scarce if the U.S. does not step up production. Plans for massive copper mines in Minnesota’s Boundary Waters region and at Oak Flat in Arizona are drawing fierce local opposition.', 'Environmentalists and scholars question how much of this race to mine is driven by the public interest and how much by extraction and other industry executives exploiting climate talking points.', '“I would push back against the narrative that there needs to be this massive expansion of new minerals,” said Payal Sampat, mining program director at the watchdog group Earthworks. Some activists point to the abundance of raw materials being mined around the world, and argue the focus of the U.S. should be on improving conditions in those operations and making the necessary investments and agreements to ensure supply is not cut off.', 'They note battery technology is advancing fast — as is recycling technology — and the materials that firms are clamoring to mine could be obsolete by the time they start tearing up the earth.', 'The debate over how much damage should be inflicted on the planet to save it may be most intense far out to sea. The Metals Co. and others plan within three years to start vacuuming patches of the deep ocean floor for nodules that contain many of the metals that go into electric car batteries along with lithium. Many scientists say the timeline is dangerously irresponsible.', 'More than 500 scientists from 44 nations recently signed a petition against the mining, warning there are too many unknowns. It could destroy entire ecosystems, the scientists say, leading to potentially devastating consequences for the broader ocean. BMW, Volvo, Google and Samsung are all pledging — for now, at least — not to use materials mined from the deep sea floor.', 'The mining is not allowed under international law. The International Seabed Authority is only permitting the Metals Co. and select other operations to collect polymetallic nodules and conduct scientific research in a few dozen experimentation zones as the authority considers commercial-scale harvesting.', '“Every single part of this nodule I hold in my hand is usable material,” said Barron, the company CEO, as he showcased one of the rocks from the giant ship that had just returned from its six-week expedition in a remote region of the Pacific called the Clarion Clipperton Zone.', '“It’s like having an [electric vehicle] battery in a rock, and they lie on the ocean floor unattached,” Barron said. “Compare that to the alternative on land, where we’re having to rip down our forests, our trees, our plants, dig up our soils, to get to metal. That has enormous unintended consequences.”', 'The company estimates that nodules on just a small fraction of the ocean floor could supply the nickel, cobalt, copper and manganese needed to build 280 million electric vehicle batteries — enough to power every car and SUV on the road in America. It’s a potent marketing point in the context of the environmental injustice unfolding at land-based mining operations.', 'The Metals Co. points as an example to cobalt, a key component of the batteries. More than half the world’s supply comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where children are exploited for cheap labor. Amnesty International estimates some 40,000 children are working in the country’s cobalt mines.', '“A person buying an electric vehicle is probably not that aware of the fact that children are mining for their batteries in the DRC,” said Bramley Murton, a marine geology professor at the National Oceanography Center in Southampton, England. Murton cautions against ruling out industrial-scale harvesting of ocean nodules.', '“Unless the whole of civilization is going back to the Dark Ages and using horses and carts, we need these raw materials,” he said. “We have to get them somewhere.”', 'It’s a complicated endeavor for many of the scientists on board the Metals Co. ship, who are not necessarily bullish on the firm’s plans to start scraping the seabed by 2024. But there are few other opportunities for ocean scientists to collect samples and conduct research that far and deep in the ocean. It is a costly undertaking. The Metals Co., known as DeepGreen prior to an ongoing merger with deep-pocketed investors, is spending $100 million on an environmental impact study it hopes to use to convince the seabed authority that its plans are sound.', '“I am not for mining and I am not against it,” said Andrew K. Sweetman, a professor of earth, marine science and technology at Heriot-Watt University in Scotland who was on the most recent Metals Co. expedition. Sweetman was overseeing collection of samples from a bulky high-tech machine that drops more than two miles into the sea and might best be described as the underwater cousin to the InSight lander that NASA sent to Mars.', 'The contraption is enabling scientists to learn how organisms function in a corner of the Earth that is scarcely better understood than much of outer space.', '“I’m getting the best environmental data that we can,” Sweetman said. The seabed authority will ultimately use that data to make its ruling. “At least I know at that point that they have the best information that they can have to make that decision.”', 'Others are less confident.', 'The seabed authority is being forced to cram its decision-making into a two-year time frame after Nauru — one of 167 member nations — recently triggered a clause in the authority’s charter allowing it to fast-track a decision. Nauru’s partnership with the Metals Co. presents the prospect of a financial windfall for the tiny Pacific island nation. ', '“Bureaucracy can get in the way of progress,” said Barron, the company CEO. “Climate change is an existential crisis. We do not have the luxury of sitting around for decades to dwell on these impacts.”', 'Yet many scientists say there are any number of deep-sea life forms that are too little known for debate to even begin. They warn that the plumes kicked up by harvesting machines could destroy ecosystems, damage the seafood industry and kill off critical organisms that could take lifetimes to come back, if they ever do.', 'When one deep-sea creature made its debut to humankind five years ago, the charismatic, milky white octopus quickly became a social media sensation. Its resemblance to a playful cartoon ghost earned the marine mollusk the name Casper.', 'The prospects for Casper are not great if the demand for electric vehicle batteries sparks a frenzy of deep sea harvesting. The octopus lays its eggs on sponges attached to the nodules metal companies are so eager to scrape from the ocean floor.', '“We don’t know what is down there,” said Andy Whitmore, an officer at the Deep Sea Mining Campaign, which is pushing for a ban on seabed mining. “There has not been enough exploration and understanding of what life there is, how it is linked to higher life forms and what happens if you remove the nodules sustaining these organisms.”', 'Start your day right ', 'Sign up for Essential California for the L.A.

6,"Environmental groups want SF to nudge Uber, Lyft drivers toward electric vehicles","Environmental advocates want San Francisco to find ways to make electric vehicles more attractive to Uber and Lyft drivers at the same time they consider a per-ride tax on the companies that is meant to ease congestion. In recent weeks, at least five organizations, including the Union of Concerned Scientists, Natural Resources Defense Council, Coalition for Clean Air and the San Francisco League of Conservation Voters, have sent letters to Mayor London Breed and the Board of Supervisors urging them to include tax breaks to push Uber and Lyft drivers toward zero-emission vehicles. Led by Supervisor Aaron Peskin, city officials are fine-tuning the language of a ballot measure that would tax each Uber and Lyft ride that originates in San Francisco. It’s expected to appear on the Nov. 5 ballotand already has the support of the two ride-hail companies.The measure is expected to place a 3.25 percent tax on single rides and a 1.5 percent tax on shared rides. The San Francisco County Transportation Authority would receive the estimated $30 million in revenue to spend on local transit projects. The environmental groups are advocating for some kind of tax treatment that would reward drivers who use electric vehicles, but exactly how that would work has not been outlined. Their goal is to have the city meet itsgoal of being a net-zero carbon emitterby 2050. But questions remain about how to implement the tax break and how the city would install the charging stations needed if a significant portion of Uber’s and Lyft’s fleets shifted to electric vehicles. It’s not clear how many would be needed, but the city currently has just under 796 publicly available charging ports. “The time for thinking and the time for studying and debate — we’re well past that. We need programs that help us electrify everything,” said Dan Jacobson, state director for Environment California, one of the organizations that wrote to city officials. “Electrifying the car-share rides should be a very low-hanging fruit program we can do here in the city, and one that should be adopted throughout the state.” Much of the tax measure is predicated on a2017 reportfrom the county transportation authority that found that there were around 170,000 ride-hailing trips on a typical San Francisco weekday. Peskin said he’s planning to add a temporary tax incentive for zero-emission vehicles into the ballot measure but emphasized that, at its core, the per-ride tax is intended to raise money for transit projects and reduce congestion attributable to Uber and Lyft. “We want to incentivize zero-emission vehicles, but at the end of the day, we want to dis-incentivize congestion,” Peskin said. “We’re going to give zero-emission vehicles a running head start. We want to incentivize them so they’re encouraged to be part of the Uber and Lyft fleets, but that doesn’t mean they get a tax holiday forever.” Peskin added that he hopes to put the measure on the November ballot with a unanimous vote of the board and the backing of the mayor. “I’m all for it. Any way to incentivize people to go electric, I’m all for it,” said Esther de Frutos,who drives for Uber in San Francisco in her electric Chevy Bolt. The ability to tax Uber and Lyft rides to fund transportation projects was cemented by 2018 legislation authored by Assemblyman Phil Ting, D-San Francisco. His bill, AB1184, included provisions that allowed city officials to create tax breaks for zero-emission vehicles, but didn’t mandate them. “I’m a champion of clean cars,” Ting said. An enticement to move toward zero-emission vehicles, he said, was “something I’d encourage Supervisor Peskin to incorporate” into the ballot measure. Another 2018 bill, from state Sen. Nancy Skinner, D-Berkeley, requires the California Air Resources Board and the California Public Utilities Commission to find ways to increase the number of electric vehicles in the ride-hailing fleets and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions per passenger mile. Both Uber and Lyft have made some attempts to reward their drivers who use electric vehicles. Davis White, Uber’s director of California public affairs, pointed toprogramsthat give drivers a warning if an upcoming rider’s trip might take 30 minutes or more, a nod to the shorter distances most electric vehicles can cover before needing a charge. In some cities, including San Francisco, Uber also gives small cash incentives to electric-vehicle drivers. Last month, Lyft announced its intent to “introduce thousands of electric vehicles onto our platform,” and make it easier to request electric-vehicle rides. It’s not clear how far along the company is toward those goals, as a Lyft spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. Neither environmentalists nor local policymakers have a firm sense of how the zero-emission tax break might actually work. Some have suggested making electric-vehicle rides available each time someone hails an Uber or Lyft ride, or allowing electric-vehicle drivers to keep more of the money from each fare. Though he asked the mayor and the board for the electric-vehicle tax break, Jimmy O’Dea, a senior vehicles analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said whatever is added to Peskin’s ballot measure probably won’t be “a strong enough incentive” to influence drivers’ decisions meaningfully. “But at least it starts a bigger conversation that maybe wasn’t happening before,” he said. “It forces the city’s hand on the (charging station) question. If they portray to be supporting electric-vehicles, they have to go all the way and think about infrastructure as well, and not just a lower rate on the fees they collect.” Dominic Fracassa is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

7,"To cut carbon footprint, SF moves to eliminate vehicle emissions by 2040","San Francisco officials want to shrink the city’s carbon footprint by eliminating the greenhouse gases belched from cars, trucks and other vehicles by 2040. The city will take the first step toward that goal Tuesday, when MayorLondon Breedand SupervisorsVallie BrownandAaron Peskinare expected to introduce legislation to install more electric-vehicle charging stations in both public and private parking lots and garages. Exhaust from cars, trucks and other vehicles represents 46% of all emissions in San Francisco, making transportation the biggest contributor to the city’s carbon footprint. About 44% of emissions come equally from the fuel burned to power and heat commercial and residential buildings, according to the city’s Department of the Environment. City officials have also introduced legislation that would requirelarge commercial property ownersto switch their buildings to 100% renewable energy by 2030. That ordinance is waiting for a hearing before the city’s Land Use Committee. Leaders in San Francisco and across the state are looking to boost the adoption of electric vehicles — and the charging infrastructure needed to encourage drivers to make the switch. In 2018, then-Gov. Jerry Brown signed an executive order calling for 5 million new zero-emission vehicles on California’s roads by 2030 and 250,000 charging stations by 2025. “To meet our climate goals and improve the air we breathe, we need to electrify public and private transportation,” Breed said in a statement. “We know that one of the biggest barriers for people considering driving an electric vehicle is access to charging, so we want to make sure our city has the charging infrastructure that’s needed.” San Francisco’s pending legislation, which city officials believe to be the first of its kind in the country, would require private parking lots and garages with more than 100 parking spots to install electric-vehicle charging stations next to at least 10% of the spaces. The ordinance would apply to about 300 commercial parking facilities in the city whose owners would have until 2023 to install the new stations. Commercial electric-vehicle charging stations can cost thousands of dollars each. But most private lot and garage operators are expected to contract with charging-station providers, so the charging ports don’t have to be bought outright. The city is also looking to grow the stock of charging stations at up to 38 municipally operated lots and garages. Charging-station providers are bidding on the chance to install up to 340 charging ports on city property. The city has installed 200 charging ports on city property since 2009. Beyond installing more charging stations, the city will consider other proposals meant to nudge more people into electric vehicles, including making street and garage parking cheaper for electric cars, finding ways to make at-home charging more affordable, and finding ways to shift heavier vehicles — like school buses and garbage trucks — to all-electric fleets. — Dominic Fracassa  Dominic Fracassa is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

8,"With new grant program, Bay Area spreads electric cars to low-income drivers","This is a carousel. Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate Standing beside his new car, a 2016 Ford C-Max hybrid with an eggshell-white exterior, Ignacio Hernandez beams. Charge the electric battery and it glides for 200 miles, swooshing along the Interstate 880 and Interstate 580 freeways from Hernandez’s home in East Oakland to his job managing a Burger King in Dublin. It purrs so quietly that Hernandez barely hears the motor, and in the long run, it will save him money: His old car, a sputtering, 1996 Toyota Camry, cost thousands of dollars a year for gas and repairs. But purchasing a hybrid was unthinkable until Hernandez got a $9,500 grant from Bay Area Air Quality Management District, through a program that aims to make clean-air vehicles accessible to low-income Californians. “Definitely cost is one of the biggest barriers to getting people in these vehicles,” said Rebecca Fisher, a program manager at the district who is helping steer Clean Cars for All. Funded with state climate investments and money from a one-time $10 million payment from a civil enforcement case against Volkswagen — which agreed to pay billions in penalties after the company admitted to cheating on diesel emissions standards — the program subsidizes new electric vehicles for qualifying motorists willing to scrap their clunkers. The old, polluting cars get hauled to a recycling plant and eviscerated, so their metal shells and parts can be salvaged. California directs a portion of its climate funding toward low-income or “disadvantaged” communities, often located in areas that are heavily polluted by automobiles, said Melanie Turner, a spokeswoman for the state’s Air Resources Board. Aside from helping finance electric vehicles, the state also pays for rural school buses, zero-emission car shares, and van pools to serve agricultural workers, among other projects. The Clean Cars for All program in the Bay Area started in March and has assisted nearly 200 people who were driving old beaters, including some that date to the 1980s, Fisher said. Air districts in Sacramento, Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley have launched similar efforts, all bolstered by the state climate funds. Fisher said the programs can continue in perpetuity if the Legislature approves them in every budget. In the Bay Area, air quality officials hand out grants of up to $9,500 for the purchase of a plug-in vehicle, along with up to $2,000 to install a home charger. To qualify, applicants must meet an income threshold that’s about twice the federal poverty line — a family of four must make less than $58,000 a year to receive the maximum grant. Recipients who choose to buy a new car can also receive a state rebate of $2,500, which won’t apply to purchases of used vehicles. For those who want an alternative to driving, Clean Cars also offers subsidies for Clipper Cards — policymakers hope to expand the program to e-bikes next year. The idea is that efficient transportation can be a means to economic mobility: “We’re providing people who are struggling financially with a more reliable way to get to work,” Fisher said. Officials also want to spread the electric car market beyond Silicon Valley and well-heeled Bay Area suburbs. Though some politicians tout electric cars and trucks as a solution to California’s problems with air pollution, the state is struggling to get more of these vehicles on the road. Cost is at least partly to blame. Electric cars are specialty items: Mass-market brands like the $30,000 Nissan Leaf are still too expensive for most people, even with a federal tax credit and the state rebate. The state set an ambitious goal to put 5 million motorists in clean-air cars by 2030, but the number still hovers at 600,000 today. As policymakers offer incentives to low-income communities, they’re confronting another problem: the widespread perception that plug-in vehicles are only for affluent people. “Moderately priced, used vehicles actually aren’t a bad deal, but people get so nervous about them,” said Joel Levin, executive director of the nonprofit consumer group Plug In America. “If you don’t know anyone who drives an electric vehicle, then it’s harder to see yourself inside of one.” Working-class people tend to be the most dependent on automobiles, because many of them live in suburbs, rural areas, or inner-city pockets that aren’t well served by public transportation. Many also cut down their transportation spending by driving older, less fuel-efficient vehicles. Hernandez, for instance, clung to his ’96 Camry for six years, even though it burned too much oil, its motor and transmission were periodically breaking and it required major repairs just to pass smog checks. Eventually, even his mechanic advised that a new car would be more cost-effective. One day in April, Hernandez was watching the Spanish-language Telemundo channel when a public service announcement for the Clean Cars program caught his eye. “It was some kind of destiny,” he said. “I don’t usually watch the news in Spanish.” He quickly applied and bought the Ford C-Max in June from Rose Motors in Castro Valley. The car cost $16,000, and Hernandez’s monthly payments are $159 for 2½ years. But he saves significantly on gas, paying $25 every 11 days to fill the hybrid, instead of $40 every eight to 10 days for the Camry. And numerous reports show that the cost of maintaining electric vehicles tends to be lower than gas vehicles. For Hernandez and others, the grants have been transformative. Berkeley resident Sean Burns said he traded a dilapidated 2003 Mercedes-Benz for an electric 2016 Volkswagen e-Golf. The Air Quality Management District supplied $5,500 for the car and $2,000 to install a charger in his landlord’s driveway — Burns lives with his wife and kids in a backyard granny flat. He’d always had a sixth sense for finding deals on used cars — “I’d never bought anything that’s not at least 15 years old, and under $3,000,” Burns said — but with the rising urgency of climate change, he and his wife, Claire, thought that switching to an electric vehicle “was the right thing to do.” They bought the new car in late November. With the subsidy, it cost $9,000 after taxes. “It was the coolest car, and we just bought it outright,” Burns said. “We’re elated.” Rachel Swan is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

9,Berkeley considers banning the sale of gas-powered cars by 2027. But is it feasible?,"This is a carousel. Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate Berkeley is taking steps to ban the sale of gas-powered cars like these starting in 2027. An electric vehicle charging station at the Berkeley Marina. A mechanic at the McKevitt dealership in Berkeley works on a gas-powered car. Berkeley is considering banning the sale of cars powered by gasoline, diesel and natural gas by 2027 in a bid to combat climate change. The City Council is expected to direct the city manager on Jan. 19 to do a feasibility study before considering an ordinance that would phase out 80% of gasoline, diesel and natural gas passenger vehicle sales. The future ordinance would not apply to trucks. Berkeley would also stop purchasing these vehicles and convert its fleet of 129 vehicles to all electric. But not all Berkeley officials think the plan is feasible. Mayor Jesse Arreguín said he’s not sure that 2027 is a “realistic timeline” for banning gas-, natural gas- and diesel-powered vehicles, though he praised the effort to lead on climate change. It’s worth noting the ban would be confined to Berkeley’s city limits, which means consumers who want to purchase a gas-powered vehicle would just have to go to nearby Oakland. Some vehicle operators expressed skepticism about requiring car sales to go electric so soon. “I don’t think it’s feasible to think that you can actually end oil and gas,” said Jerry Griggs, the operations manager at Buggy Bank LLC, a display car service — a middleman between dealers and consumers — in Berkeley. “There are some pretty wackadoo things going on in politics right now. Those people are supposed to be smarter than us and they think it can happen, but I don’t see it.” The BMW dealership in Berkeley declined to comment. Toyota and Chrysler in Berkeley did not respond to a request for comment. The city’s efforts come afterGov. Gavin Newsom announced in September that Californiawill ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035. Newsom signed an executive order mandating that beginning in that year, new passenger vehicles sold must be zero-emission. Zero-emission vehicles include battery-powered electric cars and vehicles that run on hydrogen fuel cells. The California Air Resources Board will develop a plan that ensures new vehicles for sale will be mostly zero-emission leading up to 2035. Some Berkeley officials say 2035 is too late. “The transportation sector is the sector that we have tackled the least in some ways, and it is the biggest contributor to greenhouse gases that we have,” said Councilwoman Kate Harrison. The push from Harrison and other council members comes after former Councilwoman Cheryl Davila introduced the vehicle sales ordinance in December. That ordinance is on hold until city staff conduct the feasibility study. Davila did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Trump administration challenged California’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by banning the sale of gas-powered cars, calling it a job killer. But environmentalists hope the Biden administration will embrace California’s push. “Our hope is the Biden administration will come in ... and undo some of the damage Trump tried to do,” said Paul Cort, a staff attorney and director at Earthjustice. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association that represents GM and Fiat Chrysler, did not respond to a request for comment. Arreguín expressed concerns that auto dealerships are a “sizable portion” of the city’s tax base and how the ban would affect the city’s revenue streams. Harrison argued that the city would make up the lost revenue if current dealerships transition to selling electric vehicles. In addition, Arreguín said the city also needs to ensure certain streets are more accessible for people biking and using other forms of transportation. And any transition to electric must be equitable, he said. The city may look into imposing a tax on vehicle sales of over $30,000 to fund climate initiatives — a possibility that Arreguín said he is open to exploring. Berkeley’s ordinance would likely be applied to vehicles on a staggered timeline. Those valued at more than $28,000 would be phased out by 2025, more than $23,000 by 2026 and all others by 2027, according to a staff report. Berkeley has long paved the way for radical environmental policies. In 2019,Berkeley became the first city in the United Statesto ban the installation of natural gas lines in new homes.Many cities have since adopted similar bans. That same year, Berkeley banned single-use disposables, requiring restaurants to use compostable to-go packaging and utensils There is no timeline for when the council will vote on an ordinance to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles.

10,How electric cars can keep California’s power on without more natural gas,"When we’re not driving them, electric cars, trucks, and buses can act as “batteries on wheels.” Confronted with another bone-dry summer of wildfires and power shutoffs, California’s leaders have been working on a  plan to keep the lights on. After approving a state budget that allocated billions of taxpayer dollars to fossil fuel power plants, Gov. Newsom just called for an abrupt change in strategy. In a letter to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) — the agency leading the state’s climate plan — the governor instructed state regulators toavoidrelying on new gas plants and find cleaner ways to meet growing electricity demand. This is welcome news. Burning more gas when electricity supplies get tight will only create more deadly climate and air pollution. Instead, the governor should focus on unlocking the full potential of California’s one million solar roofs and one million electric vehicles to keep the lights on. When we’re not driving them, electric cars, trucks and buses can act as “batteries on wheels.” Emerging vehicle-grid integration technologies can be used to power homes and businesses by using the batteries in electric vehicles when the grid goes down. These mobile energy sources can also be moved where they’re needed most during power outages, like backing up medical centers, fire stations and food stores. California’s privately owned electric vehicle fleet already has a combined capacity larger than the potential five-gigawatt shortfall that has state officials scratching their heads. And that fleet and its battery capacity is growing rapidly. According to the California Public Utilities Commission, the state is expected to be home to 5 million electric vehicles by 2030. So far, in 2022 alone, 16% of all vehicles sold in California have been electric. The technology is there for these vehicles to become key assets in preventing power outages, but the policies are not — yet. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Tesla just announced a  program to use Tesla Powerwall batteries for emergency power when intense heat drives up demand on the grid this summer — a concept known as a virtual power plant. Participating battery owners will be paid for exporting power to the grid when energy supplies are limited during summer afternoons and evenings. This idea doesn’t need to be limited to PG&E customers who happen to own a Powerwall. Any owner of one of  California’s million (and counting) electric vehicles should be able to export power to the grid — and be rewarded for it — when demand is high. With the right policies in place, this kind of clean, distributed, and resilient energy system is within our reach. But despite investing heavily in the transition to climate-friendly transportation, state policymakers have not yet taken advantage of the opportunity to strengthen the reliability of the grid using electric vehicles. The state’s budget includes $10 billion for zero-emission vehicles, which could be used to enhance the resilience of California’s electricity system without furthering reliance on fossil fuels. For example, electric school buses that charge during the day — and hardly operate at all during the summer — could be deployed as a fleet of batteries on wheels in communities across California. California’s public agencies  own hundreds of thousands of vehicles. These agencies should be planning to not only continue electrifying their fleets, but also to use the battery storage available in these vehicles to prevent power outages in times of crisis. The state can’t achieve Gov. Newsom’s proposed transition away from natural gas on its own. Local government energy planning will also be key in maximizing the potential of California’s existing and future solar roofs and electric vehicles. A bill moving through the legislature,  the Community Energy Resilience Act (SB 833, Dodd),would help make this possible by providing funding and technical assistance to communities looking to build cleaner, more resilient energy systems. More local energy planning would also help to reduce demand on the grid, benefiting everyone. State leaders must also prioritize clean, distributed energy in underserved communities hit hardest by power outages and air pollution. These are the same communities where fossil-fueled power plants and generators are often located, even if they’re only used to keep power flowing to wealthier communities during peak summer months. Without investment in clean, distributed, resilient energy, California’s fossil fuel problem is  going to get worse. Not only does CARB have to find a way around polluting gas power plants, but purchases of toxic diesel generators have skyrocketed as home and business owners struggle with frequent power outages. Over the past three years, purchases of diesel generators jumped by34%in the Bay Area alone. Allowing this reliance on gas and diesel to continue — and even investing our tax dollars in it — would be a massive climate and public health failure. Gov. Newsom knows this, and he’s rightly taking action to prevent California from putting fossil fuels on life support. Now it’s time for the governor, legislators and agencies like CARB to begin building a grid for the future. With one million solar roofs and one million electric vehicles to start with, California has a huge opportunity to show what a clean, 21st-century power system could look like. Fossil fuels are our past. Clean, affordable, reliable, equitable and safe energy is our future.

12,Electric Vehicle Tax Break Extension Faces Stiff Challenges in a Cost-Conscious Legislature,"Consider the political oddity that is the electric vehicle sales tax exemption: Unless the Legislature acts this year, it expires July 1. A bipartisan group of legislators, known collectively as the electric vehicle caucus, has teamed up to extend it, which is something Gov. Jay Inslee is also pushing for.And yet, extending the exemption faces daunting legislative hurdles from two lawmakers whose politics couldn’t be further apart: Senate Majority Leader Mark Schoesler of Ritzville and House Finance Chairman Reuven Carlyle of Seattle.Schoesler said in a meeting with reporters Tuesday morning that the exemption will have to fit within the context of the state budget this year. Letting the tax preference sunset at the beginning of the fiscal year means the state can start banking the revenue it would have otherwise spent. The Department of Revenue,according to the Associated Press, estimated it costs about $13 million next year and $17 million in 2017, which depends on the number of electric vehicles sold.The tax break has been singled out by conservatives assimply a perk for the affluent,as the cars range in price from about $29,000 for a Nissan Leaf to $69,000 for a Tesla Model S, and even more for other models. Killing the tax exemption means more operating revenue for public schools or other budget needs.“We have to pause and wait and see on all of the tax exemptions,” Schoesler said. “Can we fit it in the budget box? How many jobs does it retain or create?”Carlyle also questioned the value of the tax incentive, and if the prospective electric car buyer would continue to make the purchase despite having to pay the sales tax on the car. He is aggressively targeting a wide swath of the state’s system of tax preferences.House Finance Chairman Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle, on the House floor.“The electric vehicle exemption is a policy that is put in place to try to move behavior,” Carlyle said in an interview. “It’s important that we make it work for the public. I am reluctant to embrace the proverbial winners and losers, which our current tax system does.”THE EV CAUCUSThe diverse group of lawmakers, started by Sen. Mark Mullet, D-Issaquah, last fall, includes Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, D-Burien, Rep. Chad Magendanz, R-Issaquah, Sen. Andy Hill, R-Redmond, Rep. Ed Orcutt, R-Kalama, Rep. Dick Muri, R-Steilacoom, Rep. Jake Fey, D-Tacoma, Sen. John McCoy, D-Tulalip, and Sen. Pramila Jayapal, D-Seattle.Magendanz said he believes more widespread adaptation of electric vehicles would be an effective deterrent against the fact that cars and trucks contribute about half of the state’s total carbon emissions. Magendanz, who majored in electrical engineering in college, said he owns an electric BMW and an electric motorcycle.It’s not just carbon dioxide, Magendanz notes. Tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks also account for majority of the heavy particulate, such as the soot that results from diesel combustion.Rep. Chad Magendanz, R-Issaquah“From a market standpoint, we want to reduce those entry points as much as we can,” Magendanz said. “What we find with these tax incentives, they work. We want to kind of get that critical mass in the market to get the mass adoption.”It has drawbacks: A lack of charging stations in some areas of the state, and the fact that the battery charge makes it more suited for commuting than long distances. Gas prices have also plummeted in the last few months. An electric vehicle’s financial benefits will be a different proposition with gas at $2 a gallon than it was at $4, Magendanz notes.Yet, plug-in vehicle sales have grown on the national scale, from 17,735 total in 2011 to 118,773 in 2014, according to the Electric Drive Transportation Association. According to the association, two years ago the U.S. had about 70,000 battery electric vehicles and 104,000 plug in hybrids, which compares to an overall figure of 226 million registered cars nationwide.Californialeads the nation with about half of all plug-inslocated within its borders, but Washington is the only other state to have a per-capita adoption rate of more than 3 electric vehicles per 1,000 registered cars.Electric vehicle registration by county; map courtesy the Department of Transportation.Michael Mann, a lobbyist who represents Nissan in Olympia, said he doesn’t want to see lawmakers letting the sales tax exemption expire based on the drop in the price of gasoline.“The price of gas has gone down but I don’t think many people are going to believe it’s going to stay down for a long time,” Mann said. “You’re making a 7 to 10-year financial investment. Nissan has been a leader in electric vehicles in Washington state. This incentive is one of the reasons.”LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALSThere’s currently two competing bills that would extend the sales tax exemption beyond July. One, requested by the governor and co-sponsored by Sens. Marko Liias, D-Mukilteo, and Steve Litzow, R-Mercer Island, wouldcap the amount of sales tax exemption at $60,000 per car, and extend the tax break to 2025.Another bill, co-sponsored by Hill, Mullet, McCoy, Sen. Karen Keiser, D-Kent, Litzow and Jayapal, wouldput the cap at $45,000and extend the break through 2021.Any additional sales tax revenue generated beyond that would go to an infrastructure bank to install more charging stations along the public highway system. Inslee has his own measure to create the infrastructure bank.His proposal would be funded through his cap-and-trade program, which is up against stiff opposition in the Legislature this year. But Carlyle credited the governor with proposing a revenue source for the exemption. Carlyle wrote on his Facebook page in December that he wanted to see offsetting revenue for electric vehicles’ sales tax exemption, which would amount to about $60 million over four years.He said Tuesday that he isn’t a “hard no” on extending the exemption, but wants to see measurable results from the tax break. Both the Inslee proposal and the one sponsored by Mullet would require theJoint Legislative Audit and Review Committeereview the tax incentive to measure performance, which can be a mixed bag in terms of getting quantifiable data. The sales tax exemption has been in place since 2005, and electric vehicle sales have taken off in recent years through technological advancements.“I am not a ‘hard no’ on any of the proposals coming before the Legislature,” Carlyle said. “If it’s something that’s going to happen regardless of what the state does, I’ve got to be…questioning of the value. The governor’s job is to propose. Our job is to debate or dispose.”Magendanz said he appreciated the fiscally responsible approach Carlyle is taking, but doesn’t want to see the Legislature move to something that would be short-sighted.“Reuven’s taken it upon himself to be a bit more aggressive,” Magendanz said. “I respect what he’s doing. We’re up against some pretty big challenges to fund McCleary. We don’t want to make shortsighted decisions that would harm the state in the long run.”Your support matters.Public service journalism is important today as ever.

13,Op-ed: Now is the Time to Electrify Public Vehicle Fleets,"Matthew Metz is the founder and co-executive director ofColtura, a Seattle-based non-profit that is working to transition the country to zero-emission vehicles. He wrote the following op-ed in reference to Coltura’srecent reporton Washington State’s public fleet electric vehicle compliance.State and local governments in Washington own more than 30,000 vehicles. Roughly 99 percent of these vehicles run on gasoline or diesel, consuming more than 30 million gallons annually and contributing to the growing climate crisis. While much has been written about the benefits of transitioning away from harmful greenhouse gas-producing fossil fuels, many people do not realize that state law actually requires it.Effective June 1, 2018, state lawRCW 43.19.648, passed in 2007, requires that all state agencies and local government subdivisions must, “to the extent determined practicable… satisfy one hundred percent of their fuel usage for operating publicly owned vessels, vehicles, and construction equipment from electricity or biofuel.”So, how are we doing? Not well. New data published in “Recharge Required” shows most Washington public jurisdictions have not taken steps toward compliance or have only barely begun. The cities of Auburn, Federal Way, Kennewick, Kent, and Yakima have no electric vehicles (EVs) in their fleets. With the exception of Seattle, the 14 largest cities in the state only have between one and seven EVs in their respective fleets. Our counties are not doing any better. King County leads the way with nine EVs. Benton, Clark, Spokane, and Whatcom have no EVs in their fleets, and Kitsap, Pierce, Snohomish, Thurston and Yakima counties reported five or fewer EVs in their fleets. Even Seattle and King County, relative leaders in electrification, still buy far more gas and diesel vehicles than electrics.The Morning Wire: Keeping you informed on politics, policies, and personalities of Washington State.What’s worse, there’s been no enforcement of the law. Public vehicle purchases are usually made quietly and under the political radar. The State Department of Commerce, charged with overseeing compliance by hundreds of state agencies and local governments with the law, has only two people working on the issue. Furthermore, regulations promulgated by the Department do not effectively implement the law nor do they provide meaningful guidance to public entities seeking to comply. Only four of the 31 local governmental entities surveyed have an actionable plan for electrifying their fleet. Annual, legally-mandated reporting by state agencies and local governments to Commerce on progress implementing the fleet electrification law has not occurred.Besides offering numerous health and climate benefits, compliance with state law would yield significant cost savings and economic benefits. Every gallon of gas burned emits 20 pounds of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas that is the main driver of climate change. It is no wonder the transportation sector accounts for nearly half of all carbon dioxide pollution in the state, resulting in increased risks of asthma, heart and lung disease, dementia and cancers – especially in children and people living near busy roads.As for economic benefits, EVs have lower fuel and maintenance costs, as well as considerably lower annual operating costs and total costs of ownership. Electricity prices are more stable than gasoline and diesel prices, making budgeting for EVs much more accurate, and less subject to oil price shocks. Public fleet electrification would place Washington’s businesses, utilities, and governments on the leading edge of the EV revolution and help it remain competitive as the global trend towards vehicle electrification continues. Furthermore, as EV purchases increase, greater price reductions and technology improvements will occur for later buyers as EVs move through the experience curve and economies of scale are realized.While barriers to one hundred percent EV compliance still exist, EVs are practicable for much of our government fleets today. The state of Washington bought 125 all-electric Chevrolet Bolts for its fleet last year. King County Metro has purchased three electric buses, with plans to purchase 73 more by 2020, and to electrify its entire fleet by 2030. The City of Seattle has 175 EVs in its fleet, and recently opened a 156-unit EV charging facility in the municipal garage.Like all important changes to the status quo, the shift to electric fleets requires an engaged citizenry, civil servants dedicated to implementing the law, and vigilant oversight by elected officials. The law is already on the books and the technology is ready for deployment. It is time to embrace a clean future for our government fleets.Your support matters.Public service journalism is important today as ever.

14,Washington State passes law establishing 2030 target for phasing out gasoline vehicles,"The Washington State legislature has passed groundbreaking legislation that sets a target for all model year 2030 or later passenger and light-duty vehicles sold in Washington State to be electric vehicles. The new law establishes the most aggressive state goal in the U.S. for moving to an all-electric future and puts Washington five years ahead of California’s 2035 target.Clean Cars 2030passed as an amendment toE2SHB 1287, a bill mandating electric utility preparation for an all-EV future, with a vote of 25-23 in the Senate and 54-43 in the House. It now heads to Gov. Jay Inslee’s desk for signature.First introduced in the legislature by Rep. Nicole Macri (D-Seattle) as HB 1204, the bill is now the first gasoline phaseout target to be passed through the legislative process.The Morning Wire: Keeping you informed on politics, policies, and personalities of Washington State.“With the passage of Clean Cars 2030, the end of the era of gasoline-powered cars is in sight,” said Matthew Metz, co-executive director ofColtura. “Clean Cars 2030 sets Washington on a nation-leading path consistent with climate science and an auto industry trend toward a fully-electric automotive future. We applaud Rep. Macri, Rep. Alex Ramel (D-Bellingham), and Sen. Marko Liias (D-Lynnwood) for their leadership on this bill, as well as the many other legislators who made history with their votes.”Passage of this legislation takes the guesswork and uncertainty out of the electric vehicle transition by creating a clear timeline with the data, tools, and guidelines we need to help businesses, developers, governments, and consumers plan with confidence,” said Sen. Liias. “Clean Cars 2030 is a critical step to meet urgent carbon reduction goals here in Washington and can serve as a model and impetus for other states to accelerate the switch to EVs.”Since Clean Cars 2030 was introduced to the legislature on January 14, the automotive industry has accelerated the shift away from gasoline cars. GM announced plans to sell only zero-emissions vehicles by 2035, Ford said it would only sell EVs in Europe by 2030, BMW’s MINI sub-division pledged to be EV-only by 2030, and Volvo committed to selling only EVs by 2030.The 2030 target will be integrated into planning and financial decision-making by a broad group of government, automaker, utility, and other stakeholders. It will take full effect when 75 percent of vehicles on the road are subject to a road usage charge, a development which is expected within the next several years.Coltura spearheaded adiverse coalitionof more than 25 organizations advocating for the bill’s passage, including leading environmental, social justice, and faith groups across the state.

15,Are electric cars really better for the environment?,"Electric vehicles, you might have heard, have a mineral problem. Beneath the floor of an EV sits a900-pound batteryfilled with minerals extracted from around the world. Millions of tons of lithium, cobalt, bauxite and other minerals are mined, processed, shipped and refined — sometimes leaving atrail of human rights and environmental abuses. For some, that makes fossil fuel engines look good by comparison. No one wants to drive around on thecobalt equivalent of blood diamonds. But does all this mining negate the climate and environmental benefits of EVs compared to sticking with gas? I looked into the world’s evolving supply chains for the clean-energy economy. In every scenario, it turns out, the demand for battery minerals represents a tiny fraction of the amounts of fossil fuels now needed to power the world. But not everything is measured in tons. For EVs to fulfill their clean-energy promise, they need to avoid repeating the mistakes of the first Industrial Revolution. Miners and manufacturers can embrace cleaner ways to get the materials they need, and recover more of what they use. Here’s how EVs and gasoline cars stack up. Almost all cars require steel, aluminum, copper, plastic, rubber and glass. Where EVs differ most from conventional vehicles is in their battery packs. Atypical 200-mile range EVlugs around a lithium-ion battery pack that’s nearly a third of the weight of the vehicle. Much of that weight is the battery pack’s casing, structural materials and aliquid electrolytethat ferries electrons around to charge and discharge the battery. But roughly 353 pounds are crucial minerals or metals, including cobalt, nickel, manganese, graphite, aluminum and copper,estimates Transport and Environment, a nongovernmental organization campaigning for cleaner transport. Not counting steel and aluminum, says MIT, anEV requires six times more minerals than a conventional vehicle. We will need a massive increase in these materials in the coming years. Global EV sales are predicted to surpass gas-vehicle sales in just over a decade after havingblown past early projections.General Motors, Volkswagen, Volvo, Hyundai and Hondacommitted to electrifying their lineup. With jurisdictions from California to theEuropean Unionprohibiting the sale of most new fossil fuel vehiclesby 2035, thevast majority of new passenger vehiclesare likely to be electric well before mid-century. That will mean expanding today’s mines and launching new ones. “The volume is large and it’s going to get very large,” says Gerbrand Ceder, a professor of materials science at the University of California at Berkeley. Gigafactories springing up around the world to build batteries are already straining the volume of clean-energy minerals the mining industry can produce. Mining minerals is never a clean affair. Cobalt from Congo, lithium and graphite from China, nickel from Indonesia and Russia, and battery supply chains thatrun through Xinjiang, in the Uyghur regionwhere forced labor has been rampant: All of these have immediate problems, which The Washington Post explored in our “Clean Cars, Hidden Toll” series. Guinea, home to the world’s largest bauxite reserves for aluminum,yields misery for local communities. Nickel refiners in Indonesia areadopting a risky technology. Mineworkers in South Africa, the world’s largest producer of manganese,face neurological ills. These environmental and social problems are real. But compared to the track record of the oil, gas and coal industry, they are a drop in the barrel. To compare EVs with conventional vehicles, first we need to look at how much stuff we pull out of the ground tomake and fuel them. Mining minerals for the clean-energy economy is measured in millions of tons per year. For fossil fuel extraction, that’s a rounding error. In 2020, building the world’s wind turbines, solar panels, EVs and other clean-energy infrastructure demanded 7 million tons of minerals,estimates the International Energy Agency. Roughly half of this was destined for batteries and EVs. The oil, gas and coal industry, by contrast, extracted the equivalent of15 billion metric tonsin 2019. And the industry will need to extract it year after year to keep supplying energy. Clean-energy technology can use these materials for decades or, if recycled, in perpetuity. “That’s a point we’ve been trying to make for a long time,” says Kwasi Ampofo, the head of metals and mining at BloombergNEF,aclean-energy research groupin London. “Even on a volumetric basis, it’s important to highlight the fact that fossil fuels are not comparable.” That remains true even if EVs and batteries were part of a massive, global transition to clean energy. In a scenario limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, the IEA estimates the amount of critical minerals needed would be roughly 500 times less in terms of volume than today’s fossil fuel extraction. Of course, material mined isn’t a perfect gauge of environmental damage. Local environmental effects tend to scale with the amount of stuff we pull out of theground. Extracting 1 ton of copper, for example, requires digging uparound 100 tons of ore. But even accounting for this, estimates Sam Calisch, a scientist at the nonprofit Rewiring America,mining minerals for the clean-energy economy amounts to extracting about five times less matter than what’s extracted by the fossil fuel industry. “This is still massive,” Calisch says. EVs already emitless than a thirdof the emissions per mile than their gasoline counterparts, on average, if you’re plugging into America’s electricity mix. But what if you account for emissions from mining metals, manufacturing, refueling and disposal of EVs? Noah Horesh, a researcher at Colorado State University who studies life cycle emissions in the transportation sector, has analyzed vehicles’ emissions over their life spans. Horesh estimates fossil fuel vehicles generate roughly twice the emissions of an EV, even accounting for emissions from extracting added minerals and metals. This difference will only grow as the electricity sectordecarbonizes, and battery manufacturingbecomes far more efficient. People recharging with clean electricity, or driving smaller vehicles, may already see a bigger difference today. Air pollution, one of theworld’s leading killers, will decrease as well. Fossil fuels are responsible for 4 million to8 millionexcess deathseach year tied to air pollution, reportstudies in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academies of ScienceandEnvironmental Research. Cleaning up the mineral supply chain for batteries, unlike the oil industry, remains a distinct possibility. The Inflation Reduction Act incentivizes automakers to use mineral supply chains in the United States or countries with close trade relations. Mining companies are being pushed, or forced, to clean up their act as buyers, automakers and countries demand more transparent supply chains. New technology is also reducing negative impacts. None of this is guaranteed.Lead the Charge, an advocacy network tracking the supply chains of the world’s leading automakers, says many are making progress on their efforts to eliminate emissions, environmental harms and human rights violations. “But as an industry,” it says, “there is a long way to go.” You cansee their leader board of automakers here. Still, we’re starting to see some changes. Researchers and battery makers are racing to replace nickel and cobalt with metals such as manganese and iron that are safer, abundant, nontoxic and cheap. “There are only a few metals at the intersection of what we can use and what we produce a lot of,” says Ceder. “But we’re seeing significant progress in that area.” Manufacturers now usesix times less cobaltin EV batteries, or have eliminated it entirely in recent years. Last year, half of the vehicles Tesla sold in the first quartercontained batteries with no cobalt or nickel. Recycling already holds great promise. Today,only about 5 percent of lithium-ion batteriesacross all products are recycled in the U.S. Within a few decades, accordingto the nonprofit International Council on Clean Transportation, the vast majority of EV batteries will likely be collected and repurposed for a second life such as grid energy storage, or recycled, cutting the EV demand for minerals by about a third. Lead-acid car batteries provide a model: an estimated 99 percent are recycled. That has created a nearly closed loop for reusing lead, report researchers inthe peer-reviewed journal American Economic Review: Insights. “The transition to low-carbon fuels is not a magic bullet with no negative outcome,"" says Sergey Paltsev, a senior research scientist at MIT. “There is no free lunch. But it’s much less harmful than if we stay with fossil fuels. That’s the conclusion.”",washington-post,east-coast,electric vehicles might heard mineral problem beneath floor ev sits a900pound batteryfilled minerals extracted around world millions tons lithium

16,Electric Vehicles Alone Can’t Solve Climate Change,"Arresting climate change requires, among other things, the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. But managing the transition from gas-powered cars won’t be easy. President Joe Biden’s administration has proposed new rules to sharply limit tailpipe emissions, with the aim of compelling automakers to devote at least two-thirds of new sales to EVs within the next decade. For this policy to work, the government will have to get a lot of other things right. The logic behind the plan is straightforward: To eliminate carbon emissions by 2050, the US needs to slash pollution from cars and trucks. Getting more electric vehicles on the road will help. But without supporting policies, EVs are unlikely to cut carbon emissions as much as advocates envision. Policymakers owe the public an honest accounting of costs and benefits. Worldwide, EVs account for 13% of new car sales, up from 0.2% a decade ago. Their market share in the US has nearly doubled over the last year, to 5.8%, thanks in part to federal tax credits of $7,500 included in the Inflation Reduction Act. Biden’s new regulations aim to accelerate the transition, by lowering the cap on carbon emissions for new vehicles by 56% between 2026 and 2032. For automakers to meet the tougher standards, 67% of their sales would have to come from zero-emission EVs. The administration projects that this will reduce the US’s carbon footprint by 7.3 billion tons by 2055, the equivalent of eliminating four years’ worth of transportation-related emissions. Such goals are laudable, but as things stand it’s doubtful that the US can achieve them. Generous subsidies have juiced demand for EVs, but maintaining them will be costly. The average price of a new EV is still $12,000 higher than that of a gas guzzler. Experts project that it may reach parity as early as this year, but even then, Americans are unlikely to abandon their gas-powered cars if the battery-charging infrastructure remains inadequate. Note too that EV buyers don’t typically stop driving their other cars: Current EV owners have an average of 2.7 vehicles, compared to 2.1 among all households, and two-thirds use their gas-powered vehicles more often. Other factors will also complicate the transition. The auto industry’s rapid shift to EVs at the expense of new and more efficient gas-powered models might cause some consumers to keep driving dirtier vehicles longer than they otherwise would. Electric vehicles also create carbon footprints of their own, once one accounts for the mineral extraction needed to assemble their batteries and the electricity needed to power them. That’s to say nothing of the supply-chain challenges: At the moment, production of numerous vital components is largely controlled by China. EV uptake should certainly be encouraged — but alongside measures to mitigate these challenges and guard against unintended consequences. Policymakers need to speed the buildout of charging stations and promote domestic extraction of critical minerals. No less important, cheaper fuel-efficient alternatives and rival zero-emission technologies should be allowed to compete with EVs on level terms. Ideally, an economy-wide tax on carbon emissions should be part of the mix. This would raise the price of gasoline and encourage consumers to buy clean-energy cars (regardless of the technology used) while driving their older, dirtier models less. Crucially, it would also promote energy efficiency more broadly and accelerate efforts to decarbonize the supply of electricity. Granted, building political support in the US for a carbon tax is challenging. Until that changes, the government can still incentivize low-carbon transportation more effectively — by extending tax credits to gas-powered hybrids and imposing congestion charges on high-polluting cars in urban areas, for example. Fighting climate change requires a comprehensive and coherent strategy. EVs are part of the answer, but only part. Much hard work remains to be done.

17,Buy an electric vehicle now or wait? Here’s how to decide.,"Thecoronaviruspandemic saw a virtually unprecedented spike in the price of vehicles. As chip shortages hobbled the industry, automakers rationed semiconductors, installing them mainly in their most profitable, and most expensive, models. Millions of affordable vehicles, the ones accessible to most new car buyers,never got built. That drove up the median price of new vehicles in the United States from around $38,000 before the pandemic to a record$49,000 or so this February, according to Cox Automotive. With electric vehicles, the pain was even more acute — if you could find one. In February, the average EV price soared to more than $58,000,accordingto Kelley Blue Book, roughly theannual income of the median U.S. worker.Dealers have been able to charge well over the sticker price as buyers have lost the ability to negotiate. “If someone hasn’t been in the market, they’ll be really shocked by how much a vehicle costs,” says Mark Wakefield, an automotive specialist at the global consulting firm AlixPartners. The limited supply of EVs is colliding with unexpected demand. Despite inventories at a fraction of their pre-pandemic levels, EV sales are outperforming even the more optimistic projections of a few years ago. In January 2022, EVs represented just4.3 percent of new sales. This January, the share was more than 7 percent. “EVs are still hot enough they’re essentially sold out for the rest of the year,” says Ivan Drury, who analyzes the automotive market for Edmunds. But even with vehicle prices near record highs, better deals may soon be at hand. Tesla isslashing prices, prompting the rest of the EV industry to follow suit. New federal tax subsidies are coming online, though which vehicles qualify is a moving target. And automakers are releasing a fleet of new all-electric models over the coming months. What’s a prospective EV buyer to do: Buy now or wait? There’s no right answer, but the decision boils down to a few other questions: How much can you spend? What type of vehicle do you need? Do you (or your EV) qualify for federal incentives? Would you buy used or lease? Here are the key questions for an EV shopper. Yes, slowly. EVs remain well above the industry average,reportsKelley Blue Book, but prices have been on a steady decline since the beginning of the year. The new federal incentives could lower them even more. Tesla started reducing prices to guard its dominant market as some federal incentives for Tesla’s EVs are phased out undernew rules on April 18. Since January, Tesla has cut the prices of its base Model 3 and Model Y by11 percent and 20 percent, respectively. Tesla still controlsmore than halfof the EV market in the United States, and other automakers have followed its lead. The average price paid for a new EV in February fell by 1.8 percent, or $1,050, over the previous month,reports Kelley Blue Book. Another factor is more models hitting showrooms.Dozens of new all-electric modelsare expected to debut in the next two years, expanding the EV selection beyond today’s concentration in sedans and small crossovers and SUVs. Rivals could start lowering prices more as competition heats up. When it comes to electric vehicles, your options are large, affordable or long range. “You can pick two,” says David Undercoffler of Autolist, an online car shopping platform. Small sedans and hatchbacks like the Model 3, Model Y, Chevy Bolt and Nissan Leaf have been the mainstays of the market. The Bolt starts at$26,500. Recently, automakers have focused on selling somewhat compact SUVs and crossovers with ranges of about 250 miles. That includes the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Tesla Model Y, Kia Niro EV and Volkswagen ID.4. “If that’s the size vehicle they’re looking for, go for it,” says Undercoffler. “But for a middle-class family looking for a large, affordable, family, electric SUV, there’s really nothing there yet.” Selection is scarce across the board, especially for larger vehicles popular in the United States.  If you want a truck, Rivian might be able to deliver its$80,000 flagship modelin a matter of months. If you want the Ford F-150 Lightning, delivery could take as long asthree years. Expect automakers like Kia and Hyundai, both with breakout electric successes, to expand options at the lower end of the market. Toyota, after resisting all-electric models, finally released thebZ4Xlast year. And there is a distant prospect of inexpensive, made-in-China EVs arriving in the United States. China’s electric automakers are eager to enter the U.S. market just as Toyota, Hyundai and other Asian automakers did decades ago selling small, low-cost vehicles. In 2021, Toyotabumped GMas the top-selling automaker in the United States. For now, the only Chinese automaker to sell lots of cars in the United States is the Zhejiang Geely Holding Group after buying the Swedish automaker Volvo in 2010. Chinese companies face stiff economic head winds given punishing U.S. tariffs. Past attempts by Chinese automakers to avoid tariffs bybuilding vehicles in South Koreahaveled to bankruptcy. As relations with China deteriorate, don’t hold your breath for inexpensive Chinese EV imports. New purpose-built electric vehicles are now arriving. Early electric models were gasoline models with engines ripped out and replaced with electric motors tocomply with California’s strict clean-air regulations. These “compliance cars” were produced in small numbers with little exciting technology or marketing to attract buyers. “Today’s vehicles are so different,” says Drury at Edmunds. “It’s not the same vehicle anymore.” New electric vehicles not only offersuperior performance,but promise lower prices than conventional vehicles once global manufacturers ramp up production backed by more thanhalf a trillion dollarsin new investment. But no one I spoke to thought that huge technology shifts would make your new EV obsolete anytime soon, predicting steady, incremental gains, mostly in battery range and model diversity. “Buying an EV is kind of like buying a desktop computer in the past,” says Undercoffler. “Every 12 months, a newer, faster, cheaper version comes out. But if you wait, then you’ll never buy a computer.” The one thing to look out for issolid-state batteries. But even those will take quite a long time. Today’s EVs generally rely on lithium-ion batteries. These use aliquid electrolyteto conduct electricity. Solid-state batteries replace this liquid with a solid, often ceramic material. Their primary advantage is that it allows manufacturers to packabout two times more energyinto the same space. Imagine a 500-pound, solid-state battery with the same range as today’s 1,000-pound lithium-ion packs. It can fully recharge in about10 minutes, with less risk of fire. It’s also quick and cheaper to manufacture. The catch? Solid-state batteries remain expensive, resource intensive and hard to recycle. Once those obstacles are overcome, they could be a game changer. But commercial production may be three to five years away, and mass-market adoptiona decade or more. The next decade will be the American “golden age” for electrified vehicles, says Sara Baldwin of Energy Innovation, an energy and environmental policy firm. That’s thanks largely to the Inflation Reduction Act, which offers buyers of eligible EVs a full ($7,500) or partial ($3,750) tax credit for vehicles made in the United States and supported by domestic supply chains or countries with free-trade agreements. But the criteria are byzantine. To qualify for the subsidies, all vehicles must be assembled in North America. Any vehicle with batteries or critical minerals from a still unspecified “foreign entity of concern” does not qualify. Rising percentages of batteries, battery components and critical minerals must also be sourced from North America or free-trade-agreement nations. Personal income and vehicle price limits apply. Confused? Don’t worry. So is one of the bill’s key authors, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.). The senator, who insisted EV subsidies be focused on American suppliers, recently admitted he was unaware that a free-trade agreement did not exist between the European Union and the United States — jeopardizing the bloc’s ability to compete in the United States. A trade deal is being worked out now. To help you out, I’ve added adecision tree below, produced by Energy Innovation, to tell if you and your vehicle qualify for federal incentives. Another way to figure this out? Wait until April 18. The Internal Revenue Service will issuean updated list of what vehicles qualifyunder the incentive program. The list is likely to shrink before it grows, as automakers must shift their supply chains toward North America and free-trade-agreement nations to meet increasingly stringent criteria. You can alsodetermine tax credit eligibility by looking up the vehicle identification number on this Energy Departmentwebsite. “Once the list is out here, it will be pretty straightforward,” says Baldwin. “That’s the good news.” And the federal government is considering even more stringent rules to pressure automakers to sell more EVs. One of the Environmental Protection Agency’sproposed auto emissions plans, the toughest one to date, would aim to have as many as two-thirds of all new passenger vehicles sold be electric by 2032. There’s one way to sidestep many of these restrictions: Lease an electric vehicle. Baldwin says all leased EVs qualify for the full $7,500 tax credit because auto dealers are eligible to take the tax credit as commercial entities. “For those eager to start driving an EV immediately and start saving on fuel costs, a leased EV may offer a great interim solution,” she says. A second option is buying used. It’s a much cheaper way into the EV market, and there are no restrictions on the make or model for a tax credit of 30 percent up to $4,000, assuming vehicle price and buyer income requirements are met.Check out this flow chartto see if you qualify. “This tax credit could prove to be a game changer for the market given that most people buy used vehicles today,” says Baldwin. And used-car prices are finally coming back down. On the high end, the automotive research companyiSeeCars.comfound electric models like the Audi e-tron, Volkswagen ID.4, and Ford Mustang Mach-E werediscounted by 20 percent or morebelow new-car prices on average, a savings of up to $23,000. “There are deals out there if you do some research,” says Karl Brauer ofiSeeCars.com. For a more affordable option, early versions of the Nissan Leaf, Ford Focus electric hatchback and Fiat 500eselling for $5,000 to $9,000can be found. Their battery range may be degraded to 50 miles or less, but if you want a city car or a second vehicle, older models might be the ticket. From a strictly financial standpoint, it’s better to wait if you can.New cars are a financial loss the moment you drive them off the lot,collectible Tesla Roadsters aside. “Buying a new car is never a good investment,” says Wakefield at AlixPartners. “These are depreciating assets.” Putting off the purchase until you really need it allows you to get the most out of your existing vehicle. But there are exceptions: Do you have a long commute? Are you still driving a 30-year-old gas guzzler? Did your old vehicle conk out? Then EVs can have a significantly lower lifetime cost and emissions. Electricity is generally cheaper and cleaner. Maintenance like brake pads and oil changes are not required. And EVs are expected tolast much longer, with some manufacturers talking aboutmillion-mile batteries. So if you need a car right now, you’re in a better place than even a few months ago. If you can wait, your bank account will thank you. But for many people, cars are not just rubber, metal and batteries. Asresearchersandmarketersrealize, a car purchase isnot an economically rational decision. It’s about what we value. For those who want to have less impact on the climate, and need a car, an EV might be worth every penny. A previous version of this article incorrectly said the Chevy Bolt's base price was $40,875.

18,Electric vehicles are hitting a road block: Car dealers,"As news started coming out aboutelectric carsin early 2016, Michael Young, a self-described “car guy,” knew he wanted to try one. One afternoon, he strolled into his local dealership and asked to test drive the BMW i3, a small, sporty car with a range of up to 150 miles. The salesperson stopped him. “You can’t drive that car on the highway,” Young recalls the salesperson saying, explaining that the car couldn’t go over 45 miles per hour. “I was kind of dumbfounded by that,” Young said. Young knew it could go much faster — and, after convincing the salesperson to let him go on a test drive,ultimately bought the i3. The experience motivated him to launch awebsitethat helps consumers shopfor electric vehicles. But the incident underscores a problem that still plagues electric vehicles: Many U.S. buyers say car dealerships, which sell the majority of new vehicles, are not prepared for the electric transition. The Biden administration aims to have as many as two-thirds of new cars sold in the United Statesbe electric by 2032; andautomakers have investedhundreds of billions of dollarsin EVs. But if car dealers don’t want to sell EVs, the country’s electric transition could be in jeopardy. Car sales are unlike any other commercial transactionin America. For most products — everything including shoes and iPhones — you can buy directly from the manufacturer or in dozens of other stores. Cars used to be the same: Before World War II, people bought personal vehicles at big-box department stores, from the manufacturers themselves and even at gas stations. But in the 1940s and 1950s, dealerships — which were mostly single-family businesses — argued that the powerful automakers could undercut their sales and drive them out of business. Over the next two decades, dozens of states passed laws to protect dealers; many of them prevented manufacturers from selling directly to consumers. In recent years, Tesla, which does not use car dealerships, has fought some ofthose laws in court. The company has won in some states and, in others, has received workarounds that allow a few select storefronts. Still, many automakers have to sell their vehicles through one of the country’s more than 16,000 franchisedauto dealerships. And those salespeople often don’t have extensive training on how to sell an EV or even on the technology itself. Frustrated customers told TheWashington Post that dealers tried to redirect their attention toward gas cars, or gave incorrect or unclear answers to questions about charging and day-to-day electric vehicle use. James Richards, the CEO of a water heating company in Davis, Calif., spent days test-driving EVs at Volkswagen, Tesla, Chevy and Ford. But the 40-year-old found the dealership experience “cringeworthy” — the dealers didn’t seem to know much about the EVs they were selling. “I felt like I knew more than they did,” Richards said. Initially, Richards was hoping to buy an F-150 Lightning, but the truck was back-ordered. The salesperson could only get him an expensive trim that came with a high dealer markup. That markup added “insult to injury,” Richards said. He ended up buying a Tesla Model Y. Tesla salespeople “strike you as EV geeks,” Richards explained. “All the other dealerships: Ford, VW, the GM people — they didn’t seem like specialists.” Maya Batres, a 34-year-old adviser for an environmental organization, bought a used Fiat 500e from a dealer in February 2022. The dealer, she said, didn’t know much about EVs but was happy to make the sale since she and her husband came prepared. But when it came time to sign the paperwork, the salesperson offered her a plan for oil changes and an extended warranty for a gas-powered car. “I knew we didn’t need that,” Batres said, laughing. Which electric vehicle is right for you? Check out our guide. EVs are complex. There are three types of charging ports and three different speeds of charging for electric vehicles. (Young recalls a salesman telling him that he could use Tesla’s charging network for a non-Tesla vehicle, long before the company beganopening their fast chargersto other cars.) Electric cars also often come with new features like one-pedal driving and adaptive cruise control. Then there is the maze offederal and state tax incentivesthat can help drivers afford a new or used EV — but only if the dealer and the consumer can understand how they work. Some dealers, however, don’t seem to want to offer electric cars: According to asurveythat the Sierra Club conducted at the end of 2022, 66 percent of dealerships did not have an EV available for sale. That was at the height of EV supply chain problems, but 45 percent of those dealers — or 30 percent of all dealers surveyed — said they wouldn’t offer an EV even if they could. Amid concern over an EV slowdown, electric cars are sitting longer on dealerships’ lots than gas-powered cars. According to data from Cox Automotive, dealerships started the year with a roughly 50 days’ supply of gas cars and electric cars. Now the supply of gas cars is around the same, but the supply of EVs has doubled. Dealers may have less economic incentive to sell electric vehicles. Buzz Smith, a former Chevrolet car salesman who now helps train dealers to sell EVs, says it can take muchlonger to sell an electric car than a gas-powered one. A gas car, he said, might take no more than an hour in a single visit to sell, yielding a tidy commission. But for electric vehicles, “it was usually four visits, an hour each, before they would buy the EV,” Smith said. Customers want to make sure they understand the technology, how to charge it and more. “So I’m volunteering to take a 75 percent pay cut — and no salesman wants to do that.” Smith said he believes the pay structure of auto salespeople isn’t a good fit for the EV era. Electric cars have narrower profit margins, he said, which cuts into the commission a dealer can get. And if a customer returns to the dealership multiple times, salespeople may have to split the commission, again cutting into their take-home pay. At the same time, car dealerships make most of their overall profits from providing service for vehicles — not selling new cars.According to ananalysisfrom the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, just 16 percent of dealers’ gross profits came from new car sales, while 43 percent came from parts, labor and service. (The rest of the profits come from used car sales and financing and incentives.) “It’s a lot like giving away the razor to sell the blade,” said Daniel Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan who studies the laws and economics of car dealerships. That could also discourage dealers from selling EVs. Gas cars have 100 times more moving parts than electric vehicles do, and studies show that EVs have lower maintenance costs. An average gas-powered car, for example, needs an oil change about every six months, or every 5,000 to 7,500 miles. But many electric cars don’t require a major service until around150,000 miles. “They’re all terrified of that loss of maintenance,” Smith said. But EVs are still new enough, Smith said, that customers will return to dealers because they don’t want their neighborhood mechanic to try to service their car. Some dealers are working to embrace the new technology. Claire McDonald, the president of a Ford dealership in Waco, Tex., said her salespeople were excited to do the training thatthe automaker offered on how to sell EVs. “It’s a part of our future,” she said. They’ve only sold a dozen or so electric cars so far, she said, but she sees it as a key part of the business model going forward. “I’m not here to push EVs, for or against,” she added. “I’m here to help our customers understand their needs.” Mike Stanton, the president and CEO of the National Automobile Dealers Association, says dealerships have invested around $6 billion in preparing to sell and service electric vehicles. “Dealers have stepped up and done what is needed,” he said. But Stanton said the EV transition — especially with the Biden administration’s aggressive goals on electric car sales — is moving too quickly. “This is going way too far,” Stanton said. “We’ve got to consider the mainstream market, or bad things are going to happen.” Others — like Crane, who has submitted legal briefs supporting direct-to-consumer sales — say that the dealership-only model simply isn’t suited for the electric future — and may add to a car’s price tag. “Dealers don’t want to change the model,” he said. “They want to be the gatekeepers.”",washington-post,east-coast,news started

19,Why EVs won’t crash the electric grid — and more,"Climate Coach readers are thinking hard about the next industrial revolution. Thefirst energy transitionfrom biomass to fossil fuels transformed society in the 1700s. The next one will tap carbon-free energy to “electrify everything.” How this will come together remains unclear. So this week, I’ll answer a few of your questions, lightly edited for brevity and clarity, on the markets and infrastructure that need to support the transition. Then we’ll take a look at Japan, whereemissions have fallen steeply since 2012.Might it offer a lesson for the United States? Have something on your mind? You can submit questions by email atclimatecoach@washpost.com, or join one of myLive ChatsorPost Reportspodcasts to ask in real time. Let’s begin. If everyone has an electric car, will the electric grid be able to support all those cars being recharged? And if something should happen to the grid, such as what happened in Texas a few winters ago, are we all back to the horse and buggy?—Sherry in North Carolina via email We can already see a preview of our electric future in Norway, one of the countries with the highest share of EVs.More than 90 percentof new cars sold in the country were plug-in electric, according to the latest data, from May.More than 20 percentof the country’s overall vehicle fleet is electric, a share expected to rise to one-third by 2025. So far, the grid has essentially shrugged it off. “We haven’t seen any issue of the grid collapsing,”says Anne Nysæther, a managing director at Elvia, a utility serving Oslo and the surrounding areas with the nation’s largest concentration of EVs. The country, now almostentirely powered by renewables, has easily met the extra demand from EVs whileslashing greenhouse gas emissions. That’s good, because Norway will ban all new petrol anddiesel carsby 2025. The United Statesisn’t nearly as far along. Only8.4 percent of new car saleswere plug-in electric in the first quarter of 2023. But sales are growing fast:The White House wantshalf of all new automobile salesto be electric by 2030. To electrify everything — all these expected EVs, heat pumps and other big power draws — we’ll need to start building up our grid,according to Jesse Jenkins, an energy modeling and engineering expert at Princeton University. The United States must at least double its electricity supply by 2050, while stringing up 75,000 miles of new high-voltage lines by 2035, the equivalent of 15 round trips from Los Angeles to New York City, and connect new wind and solar generation to the grid. That sounds like a lot. But something like this has already been done. From the 1970s to the 1990s, the U.S. built new transmission capacity at a speed close to what is required today,writes Jenkins inMother Jones,even as electricity demand grew. In fact, battery electric vehicles can bepart of this solution. EVs are energy storage on wheels. Rather than charging at peak hours, EVs can soak up cheap, renewable electrons from solar during midday or from wind late at night. With a smart system to coordinate them, EVs should not overstress the grid. The challenge is intelligently managing how the load is distributed,not building a bunch of new power plants just for EVs. What does a solar system add to the value of a house for resale? — Pennyvia live chat Historically, solar adds value. A 2013Berkeley National Laboratory studyanalyzing 1,894 home sales in California showed buyers consistently paid higher premiums for homes with solar photovoltaic panels, which were compared to upgrades such as renovating a kitchen or bathroom. To get an idea of how much your panels boost your home’s value, take a look at how much they save you each year on your electricity bill.The National Renewable Energy Laboratory also cites datashowing “solar increases home value by $20 for every $1 reduction in annual utility bills.” A solar energy system that reduces your annual utility bill by $200, for example, theoretically adds about $4,000 to the resale value of the home. Yet the exact percentage is hard to pin down, since it’s related to factors such as geography, utility rates, the age of your solar panels, and the local real estate market. The real estate firm Zillowlooked at sales datafrom 2018 to 2019. It concluded homes with solar-energy systems sold for 4.1 percent more than comparable homes without solar power, an additional $9,274 on average. But that finding hasn’t stayed consistent, says Amanda Pendleton, who directs home trends research for Zillow. In Zillow’s most recent analysis of sales of 1.98 million homes listed in 2022, homes with solar panels did not command a premium, probably because of the exceptionally tight and expensive housing market, she suspects. “Affordability is the biggest challenge for home buyers today,” she says. “People say they want it, but at the end of the day, the question is what can they afford.” Generally speaking, the more you save on energy, the more this should increase the value of your home. But your mileage may vary. I find there are good things happening embracing history and modernism and ecology in Japan, developing and linking community with city public transport, country hiking trails, historic roads and towns viewed from ecology-minded optimism. — Junco Pollack via email In 2005, Japan’s prime minister made an urgent call to his top environmental official: The country needed to slash its greenhouse gas emissions. The Kyoto Protocol had just entered into force and Japan’s emissions were rising. To avoid an embarrassing failure to meet the climate treaty’s targets, environment minister Yuriko Koikesought a way to cut Japan’s emissionsin years not decades. Office buildings offered an enticing target. Commercial buildings have the potential for enormous emission reductions. In most industrialized countries, they’re responsible formore than 10 percent of countries’ greenhouse gas emissions. Rather than appeal to people’s sense of environmental duty, Koike transformed their workplace culture instead. The ministry launchedCool Biz, a new clothing brand in collaboration with the textile and fashion industries, featuring cooler, breathable materials. Famous Japanese CEOs modeled the styles on the runway. The new clothes meant offices could cut back on air conditioning.In public buildings, jackets were banned for government workers. Office thermostats were allowed to rise to 28 degrees Celsius (82 degrees Fahrenheit) in the summer. Researchersestimatethe Cool Biz initiative slashed carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to the annual output of several natural gas power plants. I share this story not because it is the solution to climate change — Japan’s culture is unique — but because it illustrates the types of solutions we should be exploring. Oftentimes, the most effective fixescome from rethinking old ideas, shifting social norms, and learning from others with very different experiences.

20,Most electric vehicles won’t qualify for federal tax credit,"DETROIT — A tax credit of up to $7,500 could be used to defray the cost of an electric vehicle under the Inflation Reduction Act now moving toward final approval in Congress. But the auto industry is warning that the vast majority of EV purchases won’t qualify for a tax credit that large. That’s mainly because of the bill’s requirement that, to qualify for the credit, an electric vehicle must contain a battery built in North America with minerals mined or recycled on the continent. And those rules become more stringent over time — to the point where, in a few years, it’s possible that no EVs would qualify for the tax credit, says John Bozzella, CEO of the Alliance of Automotive Innovation, a key industry trade group. As of now, the alliance estimates that about 50 of the 72 electric, hydrogen or plug-in hybrid models that are sold in the United States wouldn’t meet the requirements. “The $7,500 credit might exist on paper,” Bozzella said in a statement, “but no vehicles will qualify for this purchase over the next few years.” The idea behind the requirement is to incentivize domestic manufacturing, build a robust battery supply chain in North America and lessen the industry’s dependence on overseas supply chains that could be subject to disruptions. Production of lithium and other minerals that are used to produce EV batteries is now dominated by China. And the world’s leading producer of cobalt, another component of the EV batteries, is the Democratic Republic of Congo. Though electric vehicles are part of a global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they require metallic elements known as rare earths, found in places like Myanmar, where an Associated Press investigation has found that the push for green energy has led to environmental destruction. Under the $740 billion economic package, which passed the Senate over the weekend and is nearing approval in the House, the tax credits would take effect next year. For an EV buyer to qualify for the full credit, 40% of the metals used in a vehicle’s battery must come from North America. By 2027, that required threshold would reach 80%. If the metals requirement isn’t met, the automaker and its buyers would be eligible for half the tax credit, $3,750. A separate rule would require that half the batteries’ value must be manufactured or assembled in the North America. If not, the rest of the tax credit would be lost. Those requirements also grow stricter each year, eventually reaching 100% in 2029. Still another rule would require that the EV itself be manufactured in North America, thereby excluding from the tax credit any vehicles made overseas. Automakers generally don’t release where their components come from or how much they cost. But it’s likely that some versions of Tesla’s Model Y SUV and Model 3 car, the Chevrolet Bolt car and SUV and the Ford Mustang Mach E would be eligible for at least part of the credit. All those vehicles are assembled in North America. The tax credit would be available only to couples with incomes of $300,000 or less or single people with income of $150,000 or less. And any trucks or SUVs with sticker prices above $80,000 or cars above $55,000 wouldn’t be eligible. There’s also a new $4,000 credit for buyers of used EVs, a provision that could help modest-income households go electric. The industry says the North American battery supply chain is too small right now to meet the battery component requirements. It has proposed that the measure expand the list of countries whose battery materials would be eligible for the tax credit to nations that maintain defense agreements with the United States, including NATO members. One component of the bill would require that after 2024, no vehicle would be eligible for the tax credit if its battery components came from China. Most vehicles now have some parts sourced in China, the alliance said. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat and a leading ally of Detroit automakers, complained that Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a critical Democratic vote, had opposed any tax credits for EV purchases. “I went round-and-round with Senator Manchin, who frankly didn’t support any credit of any kind, so this is a compromise,” Stabenow told reporters Monday. “We’ll work through it and make this as good as we can for our automakers.” Manchin, long a holdout Democrat who negotiated terms of the deal with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, had blocked previous climate and social spending proposals. Manchin’s office declined to comment. Stabenow asserted that the bill was written by people who don’t understand that manufacturers can’t simply flip a switch and create a North American supply chain, though they are working on it. Numerous automakers, including General Motors, Ford, Stellantis, Toyota and Hyundai-Kia, have announced plans to build EV battery plants in the United States. Stabenow said she remains hopeful that the Biden administration can offer the tax credits next year while it works on the detailed rules for the battery requirements. “We will continue to work with the automakers and the administration on getting as much common sense into the regulations as possible,” the senator said. Messages were left Monday seeking comment from the White House and the Treasury Department, which would administer the credits. Stabenow says she’s pleased that the measure would restore tax credits for General Motors, Tesla and Toyota, all of which hit caps under a previous bill and can no longer offer them. Ford, too, she said, is closing in on an EV cap.

21,Dan Rodricks: All charged up for an electric car? Getting an affordable one is still a challenge. | COMMENTARY,"If you own an electric car or truck, or drive a hybrid plug-in, congratulations: You’ve made it to the 1%. At the end of July, there were 52,966 EVs or hybrid plug-ins registered in Maryland. That’s just 1% of all motor vehicles across the state. It has been 25 years since the first generation of the Toyota Prius — albeit a hybrid, not a hybrid plug-in with a larger battery — came off the assembly line. Since then, there’s been immense progress in battery technology, along with greater political and cultural acceptance of the environmental need to move away from gas-powered automobiles. So, given all that, you’d think Maryland, one of the wealthiest, highest educated, eco-conscious and bluest states in the country, would be further along in the purchase of emissions-free vehicles. “One percent doesn’t sound like much,” says R. Earl Lewis Jr., a deputy secretary of the Maryland Department of Transportation. “But it is, when you look at the growth rates. We had 52,966 [EVs] at the end of July. We had 600 in 2012.” That suggests significant public buy-in of a still developing technology. If not for the pandemic, the state might have reached its goal of 60,000 EVs by 2020. It’s becoming increasingly clear that more people are enticed into the cool idea of owning battery-powered cars with only 20 moving parts and no gas tank. Current sales are robust. Just between the end of May and the end of July, another 4,575 EVs were registered in Maryland. People have noticed important developments. Battery capacity is increasing along with battery production. The driving range of EVs has improved significantly. (Both the Chevy Bolt EV and the Hyundai Kona EV can get close to 260 miles on a single charge.) The price of gasoline, rigged on the global market, has people thinking about making the transition. And the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act, passed by the Senate and House — with all Republicans opposed, of course — renews tax credits of up to $7,500 for EVs that are assembled in North America and powered by batteries made with “critical minerals’' that come from the U.S. or countries with which we have free trade agreements. So there’s somefine print involved in the incentives— because of their high price tags, some models won’t be eligible for them — and all of that makes the buyer’s calculations more challenging. Still, the incentives will last a decade and should give sales in the U.S. market a significant boost, particularly among middle-class consumers. That’s the hope anyway. Biggest issue: The price point for EVs is intimidating right now. The average electric car price in the U.S. hit $66,000 in July, according to Electrek, the EV news website. Demand has dealers marking up prices. When I recently inquired about the cost of one of the more affordable EVs, a Baltimore-area dealer added $5,000 on top of the manufacturer’s suggested retail price “due to the global microchip shortage as well as the supply chain crisis.” That pushed the sale price to just short of $40,000. On the other hand, another dealer offered a manufacturer’s rebate on a comparable, four-door EV, lowering the cost to about $37,000. Timing is everything — in love, comedy and buying an EV. The federal incentives are significant, but it might be wise for the Maryland General Assembly to again offer a tax credit for the purchase of a new or used EV, aimed at Marylanders of modest means who think EVs are priced out of their reach. While the sales and marketing gets sorted, the infrastructure to support the EV future expands. “I think there’s a bright future for EVs,” says Lewis. As a deputy secretary of transportation, he serves as chairman of — stand by for the long title — theMaryland Zero Emission Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Council. That’s the group planning for the EV future, building out the electrical infrastructure to increase citizen confidence in making the transition. Havingenough charging stationson or near highways is critical. A friend of mine, ecstatic about owning one of the first Chevy Bolts, sold the car after a couple of years because he could not find enough fast-charge stations between his home in Harford County and his hunting grounds in Maine. Another friend loves his Bolt but only recently felt confident that he could locate a charging station, if needed, between Baltimore and Deep Creek Lake, in the Western part of the state. The current Bolts, the EUV and EV, have, respectively, ranges of 247 and 258 miles on one charge, and while that sounds great for daily commutes, it’s longer trips that give some people pause about going electric. So expanding the number ofcharging stationsis a huge piece of the EV future. According to the Department of Transportation, there are now 1,241 stations with 3,373 charging outlets in Maryland. And there’s more to come, says Lewis, with some $60 million in federal funds slated over the next five years for Maryland’s EV corridors. The plan is for a charging station every 50 miles, and within one mile of a highway. So, if all that holds, if the price points come down, if the incentives work, then Lewis is correct about a bright future for EVs in Maryland. Just think: Baltimore to Ocean City on a little more than half a charge and no gas.",baltimoresun,east-coast,electric car truck drive hybrid plugin congratulations made 1 end july 52966 evs hybrid plugins registered maryland 1 motor vehicles across state 25 years since first generation toyota prius albeit hybrid hybrid plugin larger battery came assembly line since immense progress battery technology along greater political cultural acceptance environmental need move away gaspowered automobiles given would think maryland one wealthiest highest educated ecoconscious bluest states country would along purchase emissionsfree vehicles one percent sound like much says r earl lewis jr deputy secretary maryland department transportation look growth rates 52966 evs end july 600 2012 suggests significant public buyin still developing technology pandemic state might reached goal 60000 evs 2020 becoming increasingly clear people enticed cool idea owning batterypowered cars 20 moving parts gas tank current sales robust end may end july another 4575 evs registered maryland people noticed important developments battery capacity increasing along battery production driving range evs improved significantly chevy bolt ev hyundai kona ev get close 260 miles single charge price gasoline rigged global market people thinking making transition democrats inflation reduction act passed senate house republicans opposed course renews tax credits 7500 evs assembled north america powered batteries made critical minerals come yous countries free trade agreements somefine print involved incentives high price tags models eligible makes buyers calculations challenging still incentives last decade give sales yous market significant boost particularly among middleclass consumers hope anyway biggest issue price point evs intimidating right average electric car price yous hit 66000 july according electrek ev news website demand dealers marking prices recently inquired cost one affordable evs baltimorearea dealer added 5000 top manufacturers suggested retail price due global microchip shortage well supply chain crisis pushed sale price short 40000 hand another dealer offered manufacturers rebate comparable fourdoor ev lowering cost 37000 timing everything love comedy buying ev federal incentives significant might wise maryland general assembly offer tax credit purchase new used ev aimed marylanders modest means think evs priced reach sales marketing gets sorted infrastructure support ev future expands think bright future evs says lewis deputy secretary transportation serves chairman stand long title themaryland zero emission electric vehicle infrastructure council group planning ev future building electrical infrastructure increase citizen confidence making transition havingenough charging stationson near highways critical friend mine ecstatic owning one first chevy bolts sold car couple years could find enough fastcharge stations home harford county hunting grounds maine another friend loves bolt recently felt confident could locate charging station needed baltimore deep creek lake western part state current bolts euv ev respectively ranges 247 258 miles one charge sounds great daily commutes longer trips give people pause going electric expanding number ofcharging stationsis huge piece ev future according department transportation 1241 stations 3373 charging outlets maryland come says lewis 60 million federal funds slated next five years marylands ev corridors plan charging station every 50 miles within one mile highway holds price points come incentives work lewis correct bright future evs maryland think baltimore ocean city little half charge gas,08-16-2022,2022,"[('1 end', 'DATE'), ('july 52966', 'DATE'), ('1', 'CARDINAL'), ('25 years', 'DATE'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('toyota', 'ORG'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('r earl lewis jr deputy', 'PERSON'), ('52966', 'CARDINAL'), ('2012', 'DATE'), ('60000', 'CARDINAL'), ('2020', 'CARDINAL'), ('20', 'CARDINAL'), ('4575', 'DATE'), ('hyundai', 'ORG'), ('260 miles', 'QUANTITY'), ('democrats', 'NORP'), ('senate', 'ORG'), ('republicans', 'NORP'), ('7500', 'CARDINAL'), ('north america', 'LOC'), ('last decade', 'DATE'), ('66000 july', 'DATE'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('evs baltimorearea', 'ORG'), ('5000', 'CARDINAL'), ('40000', 'CARDINAL'), ('37000', 'CARDINAL'), ('evs', 'PERSON'), ('zero', 'CARDINAL'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('car couple years', 'DATE'), ('baltimore', 'GPE'), ('247 258 miles one', 'QUANTITY'), ('daily', 'DATE'), ('1241', 'CARDINAL'), ('3373', 'DATE'), ('60 million', 'CARDINAL'), ('next five years', 'DATE'), ('every 50 miles', 'QUANTITY'), ('one mile', 'QUANTITY')]"
22,Rivian electric car plant blasted by foes at Georgia meeting,"MONROE, Ga. — Opponents trying to derail a $5 billion, 7,500-job electric truck plant in Georgia dominated a state meeting this week that was meant to gather suggestions on how to design the plant to mitigate any impact on the environment. The state assumed oversight over the Rivian Automotive project after opponents overwhelmed Morgan County planning and zoning officials. The plant was announced by the company and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in December, and is the biggest single industrial project in state history. The first meeting of one of the oversight committees was Monday in the city of Monroe. The Irvine, California-based electric vehicle manufacturer announced last year that it would build the facility on a 2,000-acre (809-hectare) site in Morgan and Walton counties about 45 miles (72 kilometers) east of Atlanta along Interstate 20. It plans to produce up to 400,000 vehicles a year there. Rivian, which also has a plant in Normal, Illinois, said it hopes to break ground as early as this summer and begin production in 2024. The state panel, led by John Eunice, deputy director for the state Environmental Protection Division, did not get much cooperation from a hostile crowd that gathered at Athens Technical College in Monroe, news outlets reported. Opposition to the plant has been heavy from Rutledge-area residents who say the plant will spoil their rural quality of life. Residents criticized the meeting as a sham, saying it’s impossible to make meaningful suggestions when there’s not yet a plant design and saying the state is only working to get the plant built. “I was sitting at home and I saw my governor get on TV and say Rivian, 2,000-acre plant, coming to Rutledge, Georgia and it’s a done deal,” said Pam Jones. Gov. Brian Kemp stands next to a Rivian electric truck while announcing the company's plans to build a $5 billion plant east of Atlanta projected to employ 7,500 workers, Dec. 16, 2021, in Atlanta.(John Bazemore/AP) Many speakers Monday voiced concerns about possible well-water contamination, light pollution, and the disruption of wildlife habitats and farmland for heavy industry. “I don’t understand why you are sitting on that side of the table, which is the Rivian side of the table and why you’re not sitting over here asking Rivian and Gov. Kemp to explain this environmental project and how it’s a disaster,” said Edwin Snell of Oconee County. A Rivian executive was present via video conference but did not speak during the hearing. A spokesperson for Rivian said the meeting was a valuable opportunity for the company to gather input and that the company is committed to sharing details of their plans for the site once they are complete and “meet our own high design and environmental standards.” The plant is a subject of contention in Georgia’s Republican primary for governor, with former U.S. Sen. David Perdue attacking Kemp for agreeing to the Rivian location without support from neighbors.

23,"Hogan administration won’t match California’s electric cars rule this year, frustrating Maryland advocates","Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s administration won’t be putting forward a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035 — mimicking a decision by California — before he leaves office. Environmental advocates had been hoping the Republican governor’s administration would advance a policy matching California’s before the end of the year. They argue that, by waiting,Maryland could fall behind California, where 35% of new light-duty cars sold must be zero-emission in model year 2026. Maryland must give manufacturers two model years of notice before the rule takes effect. A 2007 state law mandates that Maryland follow California’s vehicle emissions standards, which are stricter than the federal government’s. Several other states havesimilar arrangements. But the process is in the hands of Hogan’s Department of the Environment. The department decided to wait on a final approval of California’s rule by that state’s Office of Administrative Law, said MDE spokesman Jay Apperson. That approval came Nov. 30, after the policy was approved by the California Air Resources Board in August. To begin the process in Maryland, MDE must submit a policy to theAir Quality Control Advisory Board, which held its last meeting of the year Monday. Its next meeting is scheduled for March 13. Now, implementing the policy will fall to incoming Democratic Gov. Wes Moore’s administration. In a statement Wednesday, Brian Jones, a spokesman for the Moore transition team, said the administration will “work expeditiously to meet the goals adopted by the legislature” in accordance with the 2007 law. “The urgency and leadership that Gov. Elect Moore will bring to combating climate change were made clear during the campaign,” Jones added. Atthe air quality board’s meetingMonday, Lindsey Mendelson, transportation representative with the Maryland Sierra Club, said she was disappointed that the policy was not on the agenda for December. “This should be low-hanging fruit,” she said. “Manufacturers are already supporting this, [Office of Administrative Law] finalized it in California, other states are moving on it. So, if we don’t adopt it this year, it cannot be enforced in 2025, or model year 2026. We’ll be falling behind.” In response, Chris Hoagland, director of MDE’s Air and Radiation Administration, confirmed that the policy won’t be advanced in Maryland this year. “It’s the department’s intent to bring [the policy] to this council at a future meeting as soon as we can,” Hoagland said. Several Maryland legislatorsalso called on Hogan’s administrationto take action before year’s end. Montgomery County Democratic Dels. David Fraser-Hidalgo, Kumar Barve and Marc Korman sent aletterearlier this year pushing for a 2022 adoption of the policy. The Maryland Commission on Climate Change also recommended the standard be enacted this year to help meet the state’s greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. In a statement, Apperson said that Hogan’s administration “continues to conduct an interagency review” of the electric cars rule. In addition, Apperson added, the federal Environmental Protection Agency still must review California’s action. Under Republican President Donald Trump, the EPA revoked California’s ability to enact stricter vehicle emissions standards than the federal government. But President Joe Biden’s EPAreversed that decision this year.",baltimoresun,east-coast,maryland gov larry hogans administration putting forward ban sale new gaspowered cars 2035 mimicking decision california leaves office environmental advocates hoping republican governors administration would advance policy matching californias end year argue waitingmaryland could fall behind california 35 new lightduty cars sold must zeroemission model year 2026 maryland must give manufacturers two model years notice rule takes effect 2007 state law mandates maryland follow californias vehicle emissions standards stricter federal governments several states havesimilar arrangements process hands hogans department environment department decided wait final approval californias rule states office administrative law said mde spokesman jay apperson approval came november 30 policy approved california air resources board august begin process maryland mde must submit policy theair quality control advisory board held last meeting year monday next meeting scheduled march 13 implementing policy fall incoming democratic gov wes moores administration statement wednesday brian jones spokesman moore transition team said administration work expeditiously meet goals adopted legislature accordance 2007 law urgency leadership gov elect moore bring combating climate change made clear campaign jones added atthe air quality boards meetingmonday lindsey mendelson transportation representative maryland sierra club said disappointed policy agenda december lowhanging fruit said manufacturers already supporting office administrative law finalized california states moving adopt year enforced 2025 model year 2026 well falling behind response chris hoagland director mdes air radiation administration confirmed policy advanced maryland year departments intent bring policy council future meeting soon hoagland said several maryland legislatorsalso called hogans administrationto take action years end montgomery county democratic dels david fraserhidalgo kumar barve marc korman sent aletterearlier year pushing 2022 adoption policy maryland commission climate change also recommended standard enacted year help meet states greenhouse gas emission reduction targets statement apperson said hogans administration continues conduct interagency review electric cars rule addition apperson added federal environmental protection agency still must review californias action republican president donald trump epa revoked californias ability enact stricter vehicle emissions standards federal government president joe bidens epareversed decision year,12-14-2022,2022,"[('maryland', 'GPE'), ('larry hogans administration', 'ORG'), ('2035', 'DATE'), ('california', 'GPE'), ('republican', 'NORP'), ('year', 'DATE'), ('california', 'GPE'), ('35', 'CARDINAL'), ('model year 2026', 'DATE'), ('maryland', 'GPE'), ('two model years', 'DATE'), ('2007', 'DATE'), ('mde', 'ORG'), ('jay apperson', 'PERSON'), ('november 30', 'DATE'), ('california air resources board', 'ORG'), ('august', 'DATE'), ('mde', 'ORG'), ('last meeting', 'DATE'), ('year monday', 'DATE'), ('march 13', 'DATE'), ('democratic', 'NORP'), ('brian jones', 'PERSON'), ('2007', 'DATE'), ('mendelson transportation', 'ORG'), ('maryland sierra club', 'ORG'), ('december', 'DATE'), ('california', 'GPE'), ('year', 'DATE'), ('2025 model year 2026', 'DATE'), ('chris', 'PERSON'), ('mdes', 'PERSON'), ('air radiation administration', 'ORG'), ('maryland', 'GPE'), ('year', 'DATE'), ('maryland', 'GPE'), ('years', 'DATE'), ('montgomery county', 'GPE'), ('democratic', 'NORP'), ('david fraserhidalgo', 'PERSON'), ('kumar barve', 'GPE'), ('marc korman', 'PERSON'), ('year', 'DATE'), ('2022', 'DATE'), ('maryland commission', 'ORG'), ('enacted year', 'DATE'), ('republican', 'NORP'), ('donald trump', 'PERSON'), ('epa', 'ORG'), ('joe bidens', 'PERSON')]"
24,"California electric vehicle rule takes another step forward in Maryland, after hold-up under Gov. Larry Hogan","Maryland took a big step Monday toward eventually requiring all new vehicles sold in the state to be electric, with the state Air Quality Control Advisory Council’s unanimous approval of a regulation implementing California’s vehicle emissions standards. Under existing state law, Maryland is required to match California’s vehicle emissions programs, but Republican Gov. Larry Hogandelayed the rollout, meaning Maryland’s rule will take effect at least one model year later than the Golden State’s. The proposal requires anincreasing percentage of new carssold in Maryland to be zero-emission vehicles, starting with 43% in model year 2027. By model year 2035, all new passenger vehicles sold in the state would need to be zero-emission. Plug-in hybrid cars with at least 50 miles of all-electric range are allowed to account for 20% of the requirements. During a news conference Monday at the Maryland Department of the Environment headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore touted his administration’s ability to bring the regulation forward less than two months after his inauguration. “The last administration pumped the brakes on this regulation, but today I am proud to say that we’re getting rolling again,” said Moore, a Democrat. After his remarks, Moore hopped behind the wheel of an orange Ford Mustang Mach-E and took a spin around the parking lot — with a state trooper keeping a watchful eye in the passenger seat. Gov. Wes Moore drove an EV car around the parking lot after a news conference at the Maryland Department of the Environment headquarters.(Karl Merton Ferron/Baltimore Sun) “Doing good shouldn’t be that fun,” he told reporters from behind the wheel. The rule is expected to be finalized around September of this year, said Justin Mabrey of the Maryland Department of the Environment’s Mobile Sources Control Program. Before then, the public will be given an opportunity to comment and the rule will receive an advisory review from a legislative committee. In a news release Monday, Republicans in the Maryland House of Delegates blasted Moore’s decision to move forward with the program, and promoted a Republican-sponsored bill to evaluate the policy’s impact on the state’s economy and electrical grid before implementation. “This is a policy that was created in California. It is based on California’s economy, California’s transportation needs, and California’s electrical grid,” said House Minority Leader Jason Buckel in a statement. Environmental groups, including the Maryland League of Conservation Voters and the Maryland Sierra Club, applauded the Moore administration’s decision to move forward with the regulation Monday. “I’ve been doing this work for a long time, and I dream of a day like today,” said Kim Coble, executive director of the Maryland League of Conservation Voters, who served on Moore’s transition team and co-chairs the Maryland Commission on Climate Change. During model year 2026 — the gap year separating California and Maryland’s programs — car manufacturers likely will be able to earn early compliance credits if more than 7% of the vehicles they sell in Maryland are electric cars. That percentage is the requirement for model year 2025 under existing law, Mabrey said. Once the program takes effect, manufacturers also would be able to trade zero-emission vehicle credits to help meet the requirement in the program’s early years, Mabrey said. So far, 17 states have adopted all or part of California’s standards, known as Advanced Clean Cars II, Mabrey said. Maryland is not the only state running a year behind California. New Jersey, for example, did not put forward the regulation in time to give manufacturers two years of notice before the rule takes effect, and is likely to start with model year 2027, too. Maryland legislatorscurrently are debating a similar requirementfor new, heavy-duty vehicles sold in the state, including trucks and buses. That standard also comes from California, where it is known as the Advanced Clean Trucks rule. In December  2021, California also finalized its “Heavy Duty Omnibus” regulation, which aims to reduce NOx emissions from heavy-duty trucks. During Monday’s air quality council meeting, Chris Hoagland, MDE’s director of air and radiation, said the administration technically doesn’t need approval from legislators to move forward with both rules for heavy-duty vehicles, though clarity from Annapolis would be welcomed. “Whether the legislation passes or not, we hope to bring Advanced Clean Trucks and omnibus to you all for consideration,” Hoagland said. Restricted from being able to drive on public streets for security reasons, Wes Moore (D), governor of Maryland putzes back and forth in a new all-electric Mach-E Mustang on the parking lot during a media event at Maryland Department of the Environment's Montgomery Park location, reinforcing the Moore administration's commitment to keeping the state on track to achieve its climate goals.(Karl Merton Ferron/Baltimore Sun) Despite a unanimous vote in favor of the regulation, some members of the air quality council — which includes industry groups, a physician, academics and advocacy groups — expressed concerns about insufficient charging infrastructure in the state to accommodate an influx of electric cars. “Right now, it’s like finding the Easter egg to find charging at most local shopping centers,” said Ross Salawitch, a University of Maryland professor serving on the air quality council. In a letter to the Maryland air quality council, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation expressed concern that the policy includes “staggering required sales increases for a new technology that relies heavily on customer acceptance and market readiness.” As of 2022, about 7.86% of the vehicles sold in Maryland were electric, according to the Alliance. To improve on that number, the Alliance recommended an increase in public charging stations, including at transportation hubs such as airports. It also recommended the adoption of building codes addressing the need for electric vehicle charging stations. The state has about 1,300 public charging stations, said Timothy Shepherd, chief of MDE’s engineering and technology assessment division — an 18-to-1 ratio of vehicles to chargers. The administration has a goal of reaching 15-to-1, he said. But many electric vehicle drivers do the bulk of their charging either at their homes or their workplaces, Shepherd said. “There’s been a lot of focus to kind of cover what people want first, as we start to build out the program,” Shepherd said. “Obviously [highway] corridors will play an important role and shopping centers. But right now, the interest from most EV drivers is workplace and residential.” After passing the Advanced Clean Cars II regulation Monday, the air quality council agreed to draft a letter encouraging other relevant state boards to advance electric car infrastructure projects, including by exploring changes to the state building code. During Monday’s news conference at MDE, officials said they recognize the need for Maryland to improve its charging infrastructure as more electric vehicles hit the road. “It won’t be enough to just move forward with this regulation and then to simply call that alone a victory,” Moore said. “That is why my administration is focused on ensuring that Maryland leads on tax credits and rebates for folks who buy electric. It’s why we’re focusing on Maryland leading on building out a network of electric car charging stations.” Moore referenced his administration’s bill, the Clean Transportation and Energy Act, which would provide businesses and local governments with rebates to cover the difference in cost between medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicles and gas-powered ones, and expands a rebate program for charging equipment. The bill remains in committee. Brendan Jones, president of Blink Charging, spoke during the news conference about his company’s production of electric vehicle chargers at SemaConnect in Bowie. The business received a contract to produce chargers for the U.S. Postal Service, Jones said, and is planning to scale up production by adding a new site close to its Bowie location. “We’ve already made the financial commitment on that. It’s millions and millions of dollars,” he said. “We’ll have that facility up and running within the next six months here in Maryland.”",baltimoresun,east-coast,maryland took big step monday toward

25,How Green Are Electric Vehicles?,"Advertisement Supported by In short: Very green. But plug-in cars still have environmental effects. Here’s a guide to the main issues and how they might be addressed. ByHiroko TabuchiandBrad Plumer Open this articlein the New York Times Audio app on iOS. Around the world, governments and automakers are promotingelectric vehiclesas a key technology to curb oil use and fight climate change. General Motors has said it aims to stop selling newgasoline-powered carsand light trucks by 2035 and will pivot to battery-powered models. This week, Volvo said it would move even faster and introduce an all-electric lineup by 2030. But aselectric carsand trucks go mainstream, they have faced a persistent question: Are they really as green as advertised? While experts broadly agree that plug-in vehicles are a more climate-friendly option than traditional vehicles, they can still have their own environmental impacts, depending on how they’re charged up and manufactured. Here’s a guide to some of the biggest worries — and how they might be addressed. Broadly speaking, mostelectric carssold todaytend to produce significantly fewer planet-warming emissionsthan most cars fueled with gasoline. But a lot depends on how much coal is being burned to charge up those plug-in vehicles. And electric grids still need to get much, much cleaner before electric vehicles are truly emissions free. One way to compare the climate impacts of different vehicle models is with thisinteractive online toolby researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who tried to incorporate all the relevant factors: the emissions involved in manufacturing the cars and in producing gasoline and diesel fuel, how much gasoline conventional cars burn, and where the electricity to charge electric vehicles comes from. If you assume electric vehicles are drawing their power from the average grid in the United States, which typically includes a mix of fossil fuel and renewable power plants, then they’re almost always much greener than conventional cars. Even though electric vehicles are more emissions-intensive to make because of their batteries, their electric motors are more efficient than traditional internal combustion engines that burn fossil fuels. An all-electric Chevrolet Bolt, for instance, can be expected to produce 189 grams of carbon dioxide for every mile driven over its lifetime, on average. By contrast, a new gasoline-fueled Toyota Camry is estimated to produce 385 grams of carbon dioxide per mile. A new Ford F-150 pickup truck, which is even less fuel-efficient, produces 636 grams of carbon dioxide per mile. But that’s just an average. On the other hand, if the Bolt is charged up on a coal-heavy grid, such as those currently found in the Midwest, it can actually be a bit worse for the climate than a modern hybrid car like the Toyota Prius, which runs on gasoline but uses a battery to bolster its mileage. (The coal-powered Bolt would still beat the Camry and the F-150, however.) “Coal tends to be the critical factor,” said Jeremy Michalek, a professor of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. “If you’ve got electric cars in Pittsburgh that are being plugged in at night and leading nearby coal plants to burn more coal to charge them, then the climate benefits won’t be as great, and you can even get more air pollution.” The good news for electric vehicles is that most countries are now pushing to clean up their electric grids. In the United States, utilities have retired hundreds of coal plants over the last decade and shifted to a mix of lower-emissions natural gas, wind and solar power. As a result, researchershave found, electric vehicles have generally gotten cleaner, too. And they are likely to get cleaner still. “The reason electric vehicles look like an appealing climate solution is that if we can make our grids zero-carbon, then vehicle emissions drop way, way down,” said Jessika Trancik, an associate professor of energy studies at M.I.T. “Whereas even the best hybrids that burn gasoline will always have a baseline of emissions they can’t go below.” Like many other batteries, the lithium-ion cells that power most electric vehicles rely on raw materials — like cobalt, lithium and rare earth elements — that have been linked to grave environmental and human rights concerns. Cobalt has been especially problematic. Mining cobalt produces hazardous tailings and slags that canleach into the environment, and studies have found highexposure in nearby communities, especially among children, to cobalt and other metals. Extracting the metals from their ores also requires a process called smelting, which can emit sulfur oxide and other harmful air pollution. And as much as 70 percent of the world’s cobalt supply is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a substantial proportion in unregulated “artisanal” mines where workers — including many children — dig the metal from the earth using only hand tools at great risk to their health and safety, human rights groups warn. The world’s lithium is either mined in Australia or from salt flats in the Andean regions of Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, operations thatuse large amounts of groundwaterto pump out the brines, drawing down the water available to Indigenous farmers and herders. The water required for producing batteries has meant that manufacturing electric vehicles isabout 50 percent more water intensivethan traditional internal combustion engines. Deposits of rare earths, concentrated in China, oftencontain radioactive substancesthat can emit radioactive water and dust. Focusing first on cobalt, automakers and other manufacturers have committed to eliminating “artisanal” cobalt from their supply chains, and have also said they will develop batteries that decrease, or do away with, cobalt altogether. But that technology is still in development, and the prevalence of these mines means these commitments “aren’t realistic,” said Mickaël Daudin of Pact, a nonprofit organization that works with mining communities in Africa. Instead, Mr. Daudin said, manufacturers need to work with these mines to lessen their environmental footprint and make sure miners are working in safe conditions. If companies acted responsibly, the rise of electric vehicles would be a great opportunity for countries like Congo, he said. But if they don’t, “they will put the environment, and many, many miners’ lives at risk.” As earlier generations of electric vehicles start to reach the end of their lives, preventing a pileup of spent batteries looms as a challenge. Most of today’s electric vehicles use lithium-ion batteries, which can store more energy in the same space than older, more commonly-used lead-acid battery technology. But while 99 percent of lead-acid batteriesare recycled in the United States, estimated recycling rates for lithium-ion batteriesare about 5 percent. Experts point out that spent batteries contain valuable metals and other materials that can be recovered and reused. Depending on the process used, battery recycling can also use large amounts of water, or emit air pollutants. “The percentage of lithium batteries being recycled is very low, but with time and innovation, that’s going to increase,” said Radenka Maric, a professor at the University of Connecticut’s Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. A different, promising approach to tackling used electric vehicle batteries is finding them a second life in storage and other applications. “For cars, when the battery goes below say 80 percent of its capacity, the range is reduced,” said Amol Phadke, a senior scientist at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley. “But that’s not a constraint for stationary storage.” Various automakers, including Nissan and BMW, have piloted the use of old electric vehicle batteries for grid storage. General Motors has said it designed its battery packs with second-life use in mind. But there are challenges: Reusing lithium-ion batteries requires extensive testing and upgrades to make sure they perform reliably. If done properly, though, used car batteries could continue to beused for a decade or moreas backup storage for solar power, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found in a study last year.

26,"Electric Cars Are Better for the Planet – and Often Your Budget, Too","Advertisement ByVeronica PenneyJan. 15, 2021 Electric vehicles are better for the climate than gas-powered cars, but many Americans are still reluctant to buy them. One reason: The larger upfront cost. New data published Thursday shows that despite the higher sticker price, electric cars may actually save drivers money in the long-run. To reach this conclusion, a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology calculated both the carbon dioxide emissions and full lifetime cost — including purchase price, maintenance and fuel — for nearly every new car model on the market. They found electric cars were easily more climate friendly than gas-burning ones. Over a lifetime, they were often cheaper, too.

In the United States, the transportation sector is the largest source of emissions,most of which come from cars and trucks. Jessika Trancik, an associate professor of energy studies at M.I.T. who led the research, said she hoped the data would “help people learn about how those upfront costs are spread over the lifetime of the car.” For electric cars, lower maintenance costs and the lower costs of charging compared with gasoline prices tend to offset the higher upfront price over time. (Battery-electric engines have fewer moving parts that can break compared with gas-powered engines and they don’t require oil changes. Electric vehicles also use regenerative braking, which reduces wear and tear.) The cars are greener over time, too, despite the more emissions-intensive battery manufacturing process. Dr. Trancik estimates that an electric vehicle’s production emissions would be offset in anywhere from six to 18 months, depending on how clean the energy grid is where the car is charging. The new data showed hybrid cars, which run on a combination of fuel and battery power, and can sometimes be plugged in, had more mixed results for both emissions and costs. Some hybrids were cheaper and spewed less planet-warming carbon dioxide than regular cars, but others were in the same emissions and cost range as gas-only vehicles. Traditional gas-burning cars were usually the least climate friendly option, though long-term costs and emissions spanned a wide range. Compact cars were usually cheaper and more efficient, while gas-powered SUVs and luxury sedans landed on the opposite end of the spectrum. Dr. Trancik’s team released the data in aninteractive online toolto help people quantify the true costs of their car-buying decisions — both for the planet and their budget. The new estimates update astudypublished in 2016 and add to a growing body of research underscoring the potential lifetime savings of electric cars. Comparing individual cars can be useful — and sometimes surprising.

The M.I.T. team estimated the lifetime cost of the most basic model as comparable to a Nissan Altima that sells for $11,000 less upfront. (That’s even though Tesla’s federal tax incentive for electric vehicles has ended.) Toyota’s Hybrid RAV4 S.U.V. also ends up cheaper in the long run than a similar traditional RAV4, a national bestseller, despite a higher retail price. The charts above use nationwide average prices for gasoline and electricity to estimate lifetime costs, but the results may shift depending on where potential buyers live. (The interactive tool allows users to input their local rates.) Hawaii, Alaska and parts of New England have some of thehighestaverage electricity costs, while parts of the Midwest, West and South tend to have lower rates. Gas prices are lower along the Gulf Coast and higher in California. But ananalysis from the Union of Concerned Scientistsstill found that charging a vehicle was more cost effective than filling up at the pump across 50 major American cities. “We saw potential savings everywhere,” said David Reichmuth, a senior engineer for the group’s Clean Transportation Program. Still, the upfront cost of an electric vehicle continues to be a barrier for many would-be owners. The federal government offers a tax credit for some new electric vehicle purchases, but that does nothing to reduce the initial purchase price and does not apply to used cars. That means it disproportionately benefits wealthier Americans. Some states, like California, offer additional incentives. President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. haspledgedto offer rebates that help consumers swap inefficient, old cars for cleaner new ones, and to create 500,000 more electric vehicle charging stations, too. Chris Gearhart, director of the Center for Integrated Mobility Sciences at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, said electric cars will become more price competitive in coming years as battery prices drop. At the same time, new technologies to reduce exhaust emissions are making traditional cars more expensive. “With that trajectory, you can imagine that even immediately at the purchase price level, certain smaller sedans could reach purchase price parity in the next couple of years,” Dr. Gearhart said.

27,How Electrifying Everything Became a Key Climate Solution,"Advertisement ByNadja PopovichandBrad PlumerApril 14, 2023 How electrification became a major tool for fighting climate change. A key part of America’s plan to slash carbon emissions: Plug incars and trucks. The United States still gets most of its energy by setting millions of tiny fires everywhere. Cars, trucks, homes and factories all burn fossil fuels in countless engines, furnaces and boilers, creating pollution that heats the planet. To tackle climate change, those machines will need to stop polluting. And the best way to do that, experts increasingly say, is to replace them with electric versions — cars, heating systems and factories that run on clean sources of electricity like wind, solar or nuclear power. But electrifying almost everything is a formidable task.

Here’s how muchof that energy comes from electricity.Electricity as a percent of total energy consumed in 2021 Transforming the economy so that more things run on clean electricity is a cornerstone of President Biden’splan to slash emissionsto nearly zero by 2050. The New York Times used data fromEvolved Energy Research, an energy modeling firm, to visualize what the nation’s energy use might look like in 2050 if the United States were able to meet the president’s climate change goals, using technology available today or just over the horizon, while minimizing costs. In this future, far more of America’s energy would come from electricity. The country would also use less energy overall, since electric devices are often more efficient than ones that burn fossil fuels. For example, a gasoline-powered car uses onlyabout 30 percentof the energy in its fuel to move its wheels, with most of the rest wasted as heat. An electric car uses about 80 percent of its energy.

Sales of electric vehiclesbroke recordslast year, accounting for 5.8 percent of new cars sold, and the administration has proposed regulations to ensure they make up two-thirds of sales by 2032. Electric heat pumpsoutsold gas furnacesfor the first time last year. Anew climate lawis providing billions of dollars in subsidies to hasten the transition. Plugging in isn’t the only way to cut emissions. Other options include clean hydrogen fuels, biofuels or technologies that capture pollution from the air, smokestacks or machines. But for many activities, the most straightforward solution is to go electric. “If you ask, ‘How on Earth are we going to power the modern economy cleanly,’ nothing else makes sense,” said Saul Griffith, founder and chief scientist of Rewiring America, an advocacy group. “All roads point to electrification.” Still, widespread electrification faces huge obstacles. It would mean replacing more than 280 million gasoline-powered cars and 200 million home appliances that run on natural gas such as furnaces, water heaters, stoves and dryers. Many Americans might balk at switching due to costs, logistics or a simple lack of interest. And some activities, such as long-haul trucking or chemical manufacturing, are difficult to electrify. It’s also not enough to shift to electric machines if their electricity comes from power plants that burn fossil fuels. Power plant emissionshave declined 40 percentsince 2005 as cheaper and cleaner gas, wind and solar energy sources have replaced coal. But much of the nation’s electricity is still generated by burning gas and coal, andit is getting harderto build and connect new sources of renewable power to antiquated grids. “There are people who say this is impossible, and people who say this isn’t challenging at all,” said Ben Haley, an energy expert and co-founder of Evolved Energy Research. “I’d say it’s somewhere in between: It’s challenging, but it’s not impossible.” Current Electricity Use 2050 Net Zero Pathway Electricity as percent of total energy consumed in 2021 Electricity as percent of total energy consumed in a high-electrification scenario Medium-duty trucks Heavy-duty trucks Buses and rail Other Heavy-duty trucks Shipping 2% < 0.1% Buses and rail Shipping Medium-duty trucks Passenger vehicles 89% electric Passenger vehicles Aviation <1% electric Aviation Other Less total energy use in2050 2021 Current Electricity Use Electricity as percent of total energy consumed in 2021 Heavy-duty trucks Buses and rail Other 2% <0.1% Medium- duty trucks Shipping Passenger vehicles <1% electric Aviation 0% 2050 Net Zero Pathway Electricity as percent of total energy consumed in a high-electrification scenario Medium-duty trucks Heavy-duty trucks Shipping Buses and rail Passenger vehicles 89% electric Aviation Other Less total energy use in2050 2021 America’s transportation system, which includes everything from cars to boats to airplanes, still runs almost entirely on fuels derived from oil. Only a tiny fraction of cars and trucks today are electric. Passenger vehicles are widely considered the most feasible to electrify as battery-powered cars, S.U.V.s and pickup trucks enter the mainstream, thoughhigh costs and the availability of charging stationsremain major hurdles. By contrast, heavy-duty trucks that carry goods thousands of miles cross-countrycould prove harder to electrify, particularly if they require large batteries that take hours to charge. Some truck makers like Daimler and Volvo have said that a better alternative would be hydrogen fuel made from wind or solar power, though that would require extensive new infrastructure to make and distribute all that hydrogen. “Batteries are in the lead right now, especially since we already have a charging network being built,” said Tom Walker, the transportation technology manager at Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit environmental group. “But it’s not clear that electrification will make the most sense everywhere, so we should keep our options open.” Aviation is even tougher. Today’s batteries are too bulky to power all but the smallest planes. For longer flights and bigger jets, airlines mayneed other options, such as fuels made from agricultural waste or more elaborate fuels that recycle carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which are still extremely costly.

Cooking Cooking Less total energy use in2050 2021 Most homes and businesses already use electricity to power air-conditioners, lights, refrigerators and other appliances. But millions of buildings also burn fossil fuels, mainly natural gas or fuel oil, to power furnaces, hot water heaters, stoves, ovens and clothes dryers, together producing 13 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Electric alternatives already exist for most gas appliances. Electric heat pumps, for instance, essentially act as two-way air-conditioners that can provide cooling in the summer and heating in the winter. Heat pump technologyhas steadily improvedin recent years, with many models able to operate efficiently in subzero temperatures. But for many single-family homes or apartment buildings, the economics of switching from gas to electric heatmay be forbidding, since natural gas is cheap. Some homes require costly upgrades to electric panels, or new ductwork. And while last year’s climate law offers subsidies for electric appliances, many contractors are still unfamiliar with heat pumps andelectricians are in short supply. The gas industryhas also fought hardagainst electrification policies. “Every home is different and the costs of electrification can vary pretty widely,” said Ryan Jones, a co-founder of Evolved Energy. Another potential challenge: Many electric grids today are set up to deal with power demand peaking in the summer, when air-conditioners run full blast. But if electric heating becomes widespread, utilities will have to figure out how to handlesurging demand in the winter— when, incidentally, there is less solar power available. (Currently, utilities stockpile vast quantities of natural gas underground for wintertime, which is much tougher to do with electricity.)

Today, much of this heat is created by burning natural gas or coal. In theory, many companies could instead generate heat using electricity. Onerecent studyby Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that about half of industrial energy use had “high” or “medium” potential for electrification, including production of aluminum, machinery, wood, rubber and some plastics. But that is oftensignificantly more expensivethan generating heat by burning natural gas. Other industrial processesare trickier to electrify. Cement kilns and glass manufacturers, for instance, often need temperatures in excess of 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. The chemical industry, a major source of emissions, often uses fossil fuels as a raw material for its products, with no easy substitute. Perhaps the biggest hurdle to electrifying industry is the lack of incentives. While the government offers tax credits for electric cars and home heat pumps, it has largely ignored the industrial sector, whose energy use is expected to keep growing in the coming decades. Many companies are wary of testing out new processes without government support. “If we just waited around for another century, industry would probably move to electrification on its own, because it’s more efficient than burning things for heat,” said Chris Bataille, a research fellow at the Columbia Center on Global Energy Policy. “But that’s obviously not fast enough to meet our climate goals.” Electrification would require sweeping changes to the nation’s power grids. Under the scenario visualized above, total electricity demand in the United States would roughly double by 2050, even as overall energy use went down. To meet that demand, electric utilities would need to add staggering amounts of new emissions-free power while making sure that all those newly electrified cars, homes and factories don’t strain the system and cause blackouts. They would also have to construct large new power lines across the country, both to accommodate far-flung renewable projects and to improve the reliability of the grid. Yet transmission projects have become notoriously hard to build. And some expertshave warnedthat the clean energy transition will falter without them. “If we’re going to rely on the grid for so much more of our daily life, then we better start planning now to make sure it’s a lot more resilient than it is today,” said Susan Tierney, an energy consultant with the Analysis Group. It’s not a small concern. Last summer, amid a severe heat wave and electricity crunch, Californiaasked residentsto avoid charging their electric cars during peak hours. That raised questions about whether the grid could handle a surge of new demand at a time when climate change is already fueling extreme weather. There are potential solutions. Utilities, for instance,could get better at schedulingwhen electric vehicles and other appliances are charged, so that they don’t all power up at the same time and strain equipment or require the construction of costly new power plants. More battery storage could help, too. Even so, some experts remain skeptical. “To assume this will be the world we live in, in a few decades, is premature,” said David Rapson, an economist at the University of California, Davis. He has said that rigid electric vehicle mandates such as thoseby Californiaorthe Biden administrationmay be too aggressive, potentially driving up costs and stifling other climate solutions. Others point out that electrifying everything — or at least most things — will have broad benefits, including deep cuts in air pollution. Matteo Muratori, an analyst at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, likened the transition from fossil fuels to electric to “going from analog to digital.” “There’s a lot more you can do with electricity as a fuel,” he said, “more efficiency, less waste, avoiding pollution — it’s not just about greenhouse gases.” Data notes:Projections for U.S. energy consumption in 2050 are based on the “central” scenario in modeling by Evolved Energy Research. It reflects one potential pathway to net-zero emissions by mid-century that includes high rates of electrification. If, however, electrifying the economy proves more difficult than expected, the researchers have laid out other net-zero scenarios that make greater use of other technologies such as hydrogen or biofuels but that also cost more. More information about Evolved Energy Research’s modeling is available in its2022 ADP report.Current U.S. energy and electricity consumption is based on data from the Energy Information Administration’s 2022 Annual Energy Outlook that has been modified by Evolved Energy Research. It reflects only energy consumed by end users and doesn’t include upstream uses, such as energy used to extract fossil fuels or refine oil into gasoline. For some sectors, such as chemicals, energy includes both fossil fuels that are burned for heat and power as well as fossil fuels that are used as feedstocks for industrial processes.In this analysis, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles aren’t counted as “electric” vehicles, and the air-conditioning category for commercial buildings includes ventilation.

28,"Electric Cars Too Costly for Many, Even With Aid in Climate Bill","Advertisement Supported by Battery-powered vehicles are considered essential to the fight against climate change, but most models are aimed at the affluent. ByJack Ewing Policymakers in Washington are promoting electric vehicles as a solution to climate change. But an uncomfortable truth remains: Battery-powered cars are much too expensive for a vast majority of Americans. Congress has begun trying to address that problem. Theclimate and energy package passed on Sunday by the Senate, the Inflation Reduction Act, would give buyers of used electric cars a tax credit. But automakers have complained that the credit would apply to only a narrow slice of vehicles, at least initially, largely because of domestic sourcing requirements. And experts say broader steps are needed to make electric cars more affordable and to get enough of them on the road to put a serious dent in greenhouse gas emissions. High prices are caused by shortages of batteries, of raw materials like lithium and of components like semiconductors. Strong demand for electric vehicles from affluent buyers means that carmakers have little incentive to sell cheaper models. For low- and middle-income people who don’t have their own garages or driveways, another obstacle is the lack of enough public facilities to recharge. The bottlenecks will take years to unclog. Carmakers and suppliers of batteries and chips must build and equip new factories. Commodity suppliers have to open new mines and build refineries. Charging companies are struggling to install stations fast enough. In the meantime, electric vehicles remain largely the province of the rich. To some extent, the carmakers are following their usual game plan. They have always introduced new technology at a luxury price. With time, the features and gadgets make their way into cheaper cars. But emission-free technology has an urgency that voice navigation or massaging seats did not. Transportation accounts for 27 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Battery-powered cars produce far less carbon dioxide than vehicles that run on gasoline or diesel. That’s true even accounting for the emissions from generating electricity and from manufacturing batteries, according to numerous studies. Only a few years ago analysts were predicting that electric vehicles would soon be as cheap to buy as gasoline cars. Given the savings on fuel and maintenance, going electric would be a no-brainer. Instead, soaring prices of commodities like lithium, an essential ingredient in batteries, helped raise the average sticker price of an electric vehicle 14 percent last year to $66,000, $20,000 more than the average for all new cars, according to Kelley Blue Book. Demand for electric vehicles is so strong that models like the Ford Mach-E are effectively sold out, and there are long waits for others. Tesla’s website informs buyers that they can’t expect delivery of a Model Y, with a purchase price of $66,000, until sometime between January and April. With so much demand, carmakers have little reason to target budget-minded buyers. Economy car stalwarts like Toyota and Honda are not yet selling significant numbers of all-electric models in the United States. Scarcity has been good for Ford, Mercedes-Benz and other carmakers that are selling fewer cars than before the pandemic but recording fat profits. Automakers are “not giving any more discounts because demand is higher than the supply,” said Axel Schmidt, a senior managing director at Accenture who oversees the consulting firm’s automotive division. “The general trend currently is no one is interested in low prices.” Advertised prices for electric vehicles tend to start around $40,000, not including a federal tax credit of $7,500. Good luck finding an electric car at that semi-affordable price. Ford has stopped taking orders for Lightning electric pickups, with an advertised starting price of about $40,000, because it can’t make them fast enough. Hyundai advertises that its electric Ioniq 5 starts at about $40,000. But the cheapest models available from dealers in the New York area, based on a search of the company’s website, were around $49,000 before taxes. Tesla’s Model 3, which the company began producing in 2017, was supposed to be an electric car for average folks, with a base price of $35,000. But Tesla has since raised the price for the cheapest version to $47,000. Even used electric cars are scarce. Popular models like the Tesla Y and Ford Mach-E are sometimes selling for thousands of dollars more used than they did new. Buyers are willing to pay a premium to get an electric car, even a used one, right away. Joshua Berliner, a Los Angeles entrepreneur, was in the market for a used Model 3 sedan but discovered that prices were higher than for a new Tesla. “The same held true for nearly every make we looked at,” Mr. Berliner said in an email. Mr. Berliner, who owns a Tesla and wanted a second one for his wife, said he had become so desperate that he almost bought a gasoline car. “I normally wouldn’t consider combustion vehicles, but if gas prices were lower I might have pulled the trigger,” he said. The Inflation Reduction Act, which appears likely topass the House, would give buyers of used cars a tax credit of up to $4,000. The used-car market is twice the size of the new-car market and is where most people get their rides. But the tax credit for used cars would apply only to those sold for $25,000 or less. Less than 20 percent of used electric vehicles fit that category, said Scott Case, chief executive of Recurrent, a research firm focused on the used-vehicle market. The supply of secondhand vehicles will grow over time, Mr. Case said. He noted that the Model 3, which has sold more than any other electric car, became widely available only in 2018. New-car buyers typically keep their vehicles three or four years before trading them in. A $7,500 credit for new electric vehicles, another provision of the Inflation Reduction Act, would help push down prices across the board and filter down to the used-car market, Mr. Case said. Carmakers sold nearly 200,000 new electric vehicles in the United States from April through June. As those new cars age, used electric vehicles will become “accessible to a lot more people,” Mr. Case said. The problem is that many new electric cars may not qualify for the $7,500 credits. The Inflation Reduction Act sets standards for how much of a car’s battery must be made in North America with raw materials from trade allies. Several car manufacturers and suppliers have announced plans to build battery factories in the United States, but few have begun producing. “Right now with our lack of capacity for materials, I don’t think there is any product that will meet that today,” Carla Bailo, president of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich., said of the standards. “Tesla is probably close, but the rest of the manufacturers, no way.” The legislation also excludes imported electric vehicles from the tax credit. The provision is designed to protect American jobs but would undercut the price advantage of Chinese brands that are expected to enter the United States.SAIC’s MG unitsells an electric S.U.V. in Europe for about $31,000 before incentives. New battery designsoffer hope for cheaper electric cars but will take years to appear in lower-priced models. Predictably, next-generation batteries that charge faster and go farther are likely to appear first in luxury cars, like those from Porsche and Mercedes. Companies working on these advanced technologies argue that they will ultimately reduce costs for everyone by packing more energy into smaller packages. A smaller battery saves weight and cuts the cost of cooling systems, brakes and other components because they can be designed for a lighter car. “You can actually decrease everything else,” said Justin Mirro, chief executive of Kensington Capital Acquisition, which helped the battery maker QuantumScape go public and is preparing a stock market listing for the fledgling battery maker Amprius Technologies. “It just has this multiplier effect.” The Department of Energy is trying to encourage start-ups to focus more on batteries for the masses. In May the department offered$45 millionin grants to firms or researchers working on batteries that, among other things, would last longer, to create a bigger supply of used vehicles. “We also need cheaper batteries, and batteries that charge faster and work better in the winter,” said Halle Cheeseman, a program director who focuses on batteries at the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, part of the Department of Energy. Gene Berdichevsky, chief executive of Sila Nanotechnologies, a California company working on next-generation battery technology, argues that prices are following a curve like the one solar cells did. Prices for solar panels ticked up when demand began to take off, but soon resumed a steady decline. The first car to use Sila’s technology will be a Mercedes luxury S.U.V. But Mr. Berdichevsky said: “I’m not in this to make toys for the rich. I’m here to make all cars go electric.” A few manufacturers offer cars aimed at the less wealthy. A Chevrolet Bolt, a utilitarian hatchback, lists for $25,600 before incentives. Volkswagen said this month that the entry-level version of its 2023 ID.4 electric sport utility vehicle, which the German carmaker has begun manufacturing at its factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., will start at $37,500, or around $30,000 if it qualifies for the federal tax credit. Then there is the Wuling Hongguang Mini EV, produced in China by a joint venture of General Motors and the Chinese automakers SAIC and Wuling. The car reportedly outsells the Tesla Model 3 in China. While the $4,500 price tag is unbeatable, it is unlikely that many Americans would buy a car with a top speed of barely 60 miles per hour and a range slightly over 100 miles. There is no sign that the car will be exported to the United States. Eventually, Ms. Bailo of the Center for Automotive Research said, carmakers will run out of well-heeled buyers and aim at the other 95 percent. “They listen to their customers,” she said. “Eventually that demand from high-income earners is going to abate.” Jack Ewingwrites about business from New York, focusing on the auto industry and the transition to electric cars.

29,Automakers Delay Electric Vehicle Spending as Demand Slows,"Advertisement Supported by Growth is brisk but slower than expected, causing automakers to question their multibillion-dollar investments in new factories and raising doubts about the effectiveness of federal incentives. ByJack Ewing Normally a 50 percent increase in sales is considered very good. But when the number of electric vehicles sold in the United States grew that much during the third quarter from a year earlier, it was a disappointment. Carmakers and analysts had expected more. Instead of celebrating, auto executives worried that demand for electric vehicles was slackening, raising questions about their plans to invest tens of billions of dollars to develop new models and build factories. In recent weeks, General Motors, Ford Motor and Tesla cited slower sales and signs that the economy was weakening in announcing that they would delay that spending. That was a blow to the Biden administration’s plan to fight climate change by promoting zero-emission vehicles, and it cast doubt on whether generous federal tax credits for electric car buyers were working as well as policymakers had hoped. “Our commitment to an all-E.V. future is as strong as ever,” Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of G.M., told analysts on a conference call last month. But, she added, the market is turning out to be “a bit bumpy.” As a result, G.M. is waiting several months to begin selling some new electric models, including a battery-powered incarnation of the Chevrolet Equinox sport utility vehicle. Ford and G.M. have staked billions to retool factories and build new ones to produce electric vehicles, batteries and other components. If the carmakers have miscalculated, the consequences could be severe. (Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram, has not yet begun selling any all-electric vehicles in the United States.) Sales of electric vehicles in China and Europe are also growing more slowly than they were a few months ago. Still, electric vehicle sales are growing faster than any other major category of automobile, and Americans will buy more than one million of them this year, a record. From July through September, battery-powered cars accounted for 8 percent of the new cars sold in the United States, up from 6 percent a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive. But some once-hot models are selling more slowly. Sales of the Ford Mustang Mach-E, which commanded a stiff markup a year ago, slumped 10 percent in October from a year earlier, Ford said last week. “E.V.s are still in high demand,” Jim Farley, Ford’s chief executive, told analysts. But he added that increased competition had pushed down prices. Carmakers have introduced at least 14 new all-electric models in the last year, according to Cox, and stepped up production of other models that had been in short supply. Inevitably, some sell better than others. “The demand is inching up, but it’s not moving up nearly to the degree that supply and production is increasing,” said Rob Cochran, chief executive of #1 Cochran Automotive, which owns 34 dealerships in Pennsylvania and Ohio that sell nearly all major brands, including Ford, Chevrolet, Hyundai and Volkswagen. EvenTesla— which dominates the electric car market, with about half of all sales in the most recent quarter — has struggled to sell cars and had to cut prices by thousands of dollars. Some conservatives have seized on recent data to argue that electric vehicles are overhyped. Republicans like Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio have claimed electric vehicles are destroying auto industry jobs, and have proposed rolling back policies designed to encourage people to buy battery-powered cars. A political agenda is driving some of those proclaiming an end to the electric vehicle boom, said Albert Gore III, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, an industry group whose members include carmakers like Tesla and Rivian, charging companies like EVgo and ChargePoint, and suppliers of equipment and raw materials. “There are a lot of folks eager to draw a conclusion we should be less aggressive with policy,” Mr. Gore said. Some analysts said the uneven growth was not surprising as electric vehicles go from being a niche product to a more mass market offering. Most car owners are still learning about the technology, and carmakers and dealers are figuring out how best to sell to them. “We had a lot of early adopters buy expensive electric vehicles,” said Tom Narayan, global autos analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “Now you’re at the point where the Main Street consumer is looking at E.V.s.” Ford illustrates the mixed signals that sales figures are sending. While sales of the Mach-E were up just 1.5 percent in the first 10 months of the year, sales of the F-150 Lightning, a battery-powered pickup, surged 43 percent. All told, sales of Ford electric vehicles rose 13 percent from January through October while sales of cars and trucks with internal combustion engines were up 7 percent. Sales of hybrid vehicles, which combine electric propulsion with internal combustion engines, climbed 19 percent. The weak Mach-E sales probably reflect competition from the Tesla Model Y more than any broader trend, analysts said. Many buyers might be comparing the two vehicles, which are of a similar size and style. Tesla has cut the price of the Model Y so that the least expensive model is $2,500 less than the Ford after federal tax credits are applied. The end of theUnited Automobile Workers’ recent strikesagainst Ford, G.M. and Stellantis has refocused attention on traditional carmakers’ attempts to compete with Tesla. Electric vehicles played an important role in the U.A.W. negotiations, and tentative contract agreements extend at least some union privileges to workers at new battery factories. But the deals will increase manufacturing costs and make it that much harder for Ford, G.M. and Stellantis to catch up to Tesla, which is not unionized. Buyers remain interested in electric vehicles, surveys show, but struggle to afford them. The average price paid for an electric vehicle in the United States was less than $51,000 in September, according to Cox Automotive. That’s a huge decline from last year’s $65,000. But it’s still too high for many new-car buyers, especially as high interest rates have made monthly car payments more expensive. The average rate on a car loan is more than 8 percent, according to Federal Reserve data, compared with less than 5 percent in early 2022. In the last few years, carmakers flooded the market with S.U.V.s aimed at affluent suburban homeowners. And there is still a dearth of cars priced below $30,000 that middle-class buyers can afford. “A lot of automakers were rushing vehicles into the market,” said Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights and analytics at CarGurus, an online car marketplace. “Now they’re running into a situation in a rising interest rate environment that they are not priced properly.” Some would-be electric vehicle buyers may also be worried about finding enough places to quickly charge cars on road trips. After price, charging infrastructure is the No. 1 thing people worry about when considering an E.V., many surveys conclude. Public charging is also essential for anyone who lives in an apartment or can’t install a home charger, a group that skews young. “The younger demographic is more open to electric vehicles than the older demographic,” Mr. Cochran, the Ohio and Pennsylvania dealer, said. “Typically it’s the younger demographic that’s in apartment settings. The fact that the infrastructure is not built up is a deterrent.” At least two of Mr. Cochran’s customers returned newly purchased electric vehicles after discovering there weren’t enough chargers near their homes, he said. For people interested in buying an electric vehicle, the good news is that prices are likely to continue falling as carmakers ramp up new factories. Starting in January, dealers will be able to apply federal tax credits of up to $7,500 when a customer buys a car. Previously, buyers had to wait until they filed their taxes to claim the credit. The charging system is also improving, albeit slowly. Parts of Tesla’s network of fast chargers, the largest in the United States, will open to Ford, G.M. and other brands next year. Other carmakers are building their own chargers. Mercedes-Benz said last week that it would install at least 55 stations at high-end shopping malls in the United States and Canada operated by Simon Property Group, a large real estate firm. Carmakers have gotten the message that selling electric vehicles is different from selling gasoline cars. “Charging,” said Andrew Cornelia, chief executive of Mercedes’s high-power charging unit in North America, “is still a critical problem to solve.” Jack Ewingwrites about the auto industry with an emphasis on electric vehicles.More about Jack Ewing

30,Electric vehicle charging stations could be boost for small towns along Illinois highways,"
I have owned and driven an electric vehicle exclusively for almost two years. My experience says that while the electric charging station infrastructure in Chicago and the suburbs is okay, our state really falls down once you start driving south and west. Given that the majority of electric vehicle owners charge their vehicles at home, the real robust need for charging stations is away from major population centers.Along the state’s highways, there is great room for improvement. Lawmakers need to understand that installing a Level 3 charger draws someone to their community for longer than a quick fill-up. Electric vehicle owners often plan meals and shopping around their stops. This can be a business magnet for any community that installs the equipment.Don Anderson, Oak Park

Magical new worries about deficitIn a letter on Monday, a Sun-Times reader argued that President Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan is fiscally irresponsible. But the same reader has previous argued that President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cut was wonderful. That tax cut did not deliver the “four, five, six percent” growth that Trump had promised, but it did add $1 trillion a year to the federal deficit. So when a tax cut mostly benefits corporations and the wealthiest among us, there is no need to worry about the debt? But when there is an infrastructure plan that would benefit all of us, then the debt becomes all-important?  Kevin Coughlin, Evanston

31,"Pritzker signs electric vehicle legislation, aims to make Illinois a leader in ‘clean transportation revolution’","
Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday signed legislation aimed at drawing electric vehicle manufacturers to the state, a law he said will help Illinois usher in an era of “electric school buses, electric municipal buses, electric delivery trucks, electric 18-wheelers and so much more.”“With this new focus on electric vehicles, our state can also become a leader in the clean transportation revolution,” Pritzker said at the bill signing in Rockford Tuesday morning.The Reimagining Electric Vehicles in Illinois Act provides incentives for electric vehicle production across Illinois to help reach a 2030 goal of putting one million electric cars on the road.

The new law includes tax credits and exemptions for electric vehicle manufacturers and projects ranging from income tax withholding to credits for training costs and allowing local jurisdictions to ease property taxes for projects focused on electric-powered cars.The legislation also offers incentives for employers to locate their facilities in communities that have faced disinvestment historically. Pritzker said the act is intended to attract more electric vehicle makers, charging stations  and automotive parts manufacturers helping Illinois “become one of the leading [electric vehicle] hubs in the entire nation.”“Not only can we lead in the fight against climate change, we can also create thousands of jobs for hardworking Illinoisans in the process,” Pritzker said. “The Reimagining Electric Vehicles Act is about acknowledging that there doesn’t need to be a trade-off between a cleaner environment and more jobs. We can do both, and today we take a giant leap forward in that quest.”
During his trip overseas for the U.N.’s climate conference, Pritzker told the Chicago Sun-Times last week he had two goals: Tout the electric vehicle incentive legislation and meet with companies and business leaders in the industry to attract them to Illinois.Pritzker said the state’s location, workforce, transportation system — namely being a hub for major railroads — make Illinois “one of the most attractive in the country” for electric vehicle makers and the governor felt he and his team were “successful in planting seeds.”The law Pritzker signed Tuesday follows the Legislature’s passage of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act in September. That legislation, which overhauls the state’s energy sector, puts Illinois on a path to 100% clean energy by 2050 through a mix of providing subsidies to nuclear plants and setting closure timelines for coal and natural gas firing facilities among other things.

The subsidies include nearly $700 million over five years to Exelon nuclear plants. Municipal coal-burning plants — such as Prairie State and Springfield’s City Water, Light and Power — must cut their emissions by 45% by 2035 before closing 10 years later unless they can generate green hydrogen or use similar technology to get to zero carbon emissions.At the signing of the climate and jobs act, Pritzker said that law helps the state do everything it can “to fight, to stop, and even reverse, the damage that’s been done to our climate. “As of today, Illinois is a force for good, for an environmental future we can be proud of,” Pritzker said.

32,Illinois is sitting on millions that could be spent to promote electric cars and cleaner air,"
Illinois has an electric vehicle chicken-and-egg problem. More people and government agencies would use electric vehicles if there were more charging stations, and there would be a better argument for building more charging stations if more people and government agencies used electric vehicles.Fortunately, a big wad of cash is sitting largely untouched in a state fund that could be used to resolve the conundrum, and it would be perfectly appropriate to do so. The state should spend the funds to help jump-start its electric vehicle conversion agenda.

In 2016 and 2017, Illinois received $108 million from Volkswagen as part of a nationwide resolution of legal claims against the automaker, which had been caught secretly installing software on diesel cars to cheat the system and pass air quality tests. Of that money, $89 million still sits in the state’s Volkswagen Environmental Mitigation Trust fund.We can’t think of a better use for those funds than to speed up the state’s conversion to electric vehicles. Conventional trucks and cars have surpassed power plants as the prime source of the greenhouse gases that are overheating the planet.At the same time, given that the power for electric vehicles ultimately comes from power plants, Illinois must do more to convert to sources of renewable energy, such as wind and solar. The Volkswagen money sits largely unspent because the original plan for the fund, drawn up by the Rauner administration, emphasized the continued use of fossil fuels, such as replacing old diesel engines with newer ones. The plan should have been revised when Rauner left office, but it has not.We need a new plan now.The money from the Volkswagen trust could be coupled with about $70 million set aside for vehicle electrification in Illinois’ 2019 capital bill — money that also has been just sitting around. That money is earmarked for installing electric charging stations in low-income areas and electrifying public transit, but none of the funds has been spent in two years.

Additional money might also soon be available. The Clean Energy Jobs Act, which remains stalled in the Legislature, includes more than $700 million for transportation electrification, including public vehicles, school buses and charging infrastructure where the private sector has failed to provide it. President Joe Biden’s proposed $2 trillion infrastructure bill includes money for electric vehicle charging stations, retooling factories, credits for those who buy electric vehicles and electrifying the federal fleet. Time will tell how much of that funding comes through, but Gov. J.B. Pritzker — who says he wants to see 750,000 electric vehicles on Illinois roads by the year 2030 — has no reason to wait. By tapping those Volkswagen funds, he could do more right now to achieve that goal.Send letters to letters@suntimes.com.

33,Bring electric vehicle manufacturing to Illinois to help spark our economy,"
As some corporate headquarters decamp for other states, Gov. J.B. Pritzker needs to come through on his effort to make the state a center of electric vehicle manufacturing.Last week, freight car company TTX announced it is moving its headquarters to North Carolina. That follows headquarters departures last year by Boeing, Caterpillar, Citadel Securities and Highland Ventures. Also, Tyson Foods announced last year it would move jobs from Chicago to Arkansas. In decisions affecting fewer employees, other companies have moved in or out of Illinois or expanded or reduced their footprints.In Britain last week, Pritzker led a trade mission to ask companies that supply parts for electric vehicles to see Illinois as a good place to do business. The governor has said he wants to make Illinois a center of electric vehicle manufacturing, and he has been in talks to lure a major electric vehicle battery plant.

That would not only bring jobs to the state but also help Illinois meet Pritzker’s goal of 1 million electric vehicles on Illinois roads by 2030, as well as help offset revenue lost as other jobs have left the state.

In 2021, Lion Electric opened an electric bus manufacturing plant in Joliet. In 2019, Rivian Automotive moved into a former Mitsubishi plant in Normal to start building electric vehicles. But Illinois needs to build on those successes if it is to become an electric vehicle manufacturing center.

To help get there, the Legislature in 2021 passed the Reimagining Energy and Vehicles in Illinois Act, which provides incentives to lure companies in the electric vehicle supply chain and promote renewable energy. Another law passed last year will require new or renovated homes to have conduits to charge electric vehicles.Moreover, the federal Inflation Reduction Act and the National Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provide incentives for electric vehicles, and in January, Pritzker signed a bill setting out requirements for electric vehicle parking spaces.
But Illinois ought to do more to boost the market for electric vehicles. In its latest budget, the state trimmed about $7.3 million from its electric vehicle rebate program, cutting it to about $12 million. In the previous year, $19.3 million was available for the rebates, which give $4,000 to customers who buy new or used EVs from licensed dealers. Demand was so high, the program ran out of money about halfway through the fiscal year.More money should be made available for rebates, though perhaps better targeted, to avoid them going to people buying top-end models who could afford to buy electric cars without rebates.Illinois also should adopt the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, to phase out most gasoline-powered heavy-duty trucks and step up the efforts to get more electricity-powered vehicles on the roads.It also should raise emission standards, as some other states have done, including Minnesota in the Midwest, which would have the effect of requiring national auto manufacturers to sell a higher percentage of electric vehicles in Illinois, helping to create a bigger market here.

Manufacturing electric vehicles is a growth market. Nationally, EV sales are on a pace to top 1 million this year, a milestone, and sales were up in the second quarter by 50% over the same time last year, although there are signs that demand is not keeping up with production as fewer models qualify for federal tax credits.Seeing corporate jobs leaving Illinois is not a good trend. But the nation’s major auto manufacturers are committed to building more electric vehicles, and Pritzker can help offset the loss of corporate jobs if he succeeds in bringing a healthy chunk of those electric vehicle jobs to Illinois.The Sun-Times welcomes letters to the editor and op-eds. See our guidelines.Send letters to letters@suntimes.com.

34,EVs are only part of the solution,"Arresting climate change requires, among other things, the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. But managing the transition from gas-powered cars won't be easy. President Joe Biden's administration has proposed new rules to sharply limit tailpipe emissions, with the aim of compelling automakers to devote at least two-thirds of new sales to EVs within the next decade. For this policy to work, the government will have to get a lot of other things right. The logic behind the plan is straightforward: To eliminate carbon emissions by 2050, the U.S. needs to slash pollution from cars and trucks. Getting more electric vehicles on the road will help. But without supporting policies, EVs are unlikely to cut carbon emissions as much as advocates envision. Policymakers owe the public an honest accounting of costs and benefits. Worldwide, EVs account for 13% of new car sales, up from 0.2% a decade ago. Their market share in the U.S. has nearly doubled over the last year, to 5.8%, thanks in part to federal tax credits of $7,500 included in the Inflation Reduction Act. Biden's new regulations aim to accelerate the transition, by lowering the cap on carbon emissions for new vehicles by 56% between 2026 and 2032. For automakers to meet the tougher standards, 67% of their sales would have to come from zero-emission EVs. The administration projects that this would reduce the U.S.'s carbon footprint by 7.3 billion tons by 2055, the equivalent of eliminating four years' worth of transportation-related emissions. Such goals are laudable, but as things stand it's doubtful that the U.S. can achieve them. Generous subsidies have juiced demand for EVs, but maintaining them will be costly. The average price of a new EV is still $12,000 higher than that of a gas guzzler. Experts project that it may reach parity as early as this year, but even then, Americans are unlikely to abandon their gas-powered cars if the battery-charging infrastructure remains inadequate. Note too that EV buyers don't typically stop driving their other cars: Current EV owners have an average of 2.7 vehicles, compared to 2.1 among all households, and two-thirds use their gas-powered vehicles more often. Other factors will also complicate the transition. The auto industry's rapid shift to EVs at the expense of new and more efficient gas-powered models might cause some consumers to keep driving dirtier vehicles longer than they otherwise would. Electric vehicles also create carbon footprints of their own, once one accounts for the mineral extraction needed to assemble their batteries and the electricity needed to power them. That's to say nothing of the supply-chain challenges: At the moment, the production of numerous vital components is largely controlled by China. EV uptake should certainly be encouraged — but alongside measures to mitigate these challenges and guard against unintended consequences. Policymakers need to speed the buildout of charging stations and promote domestic extraction of critical minerals. No less important, cheaper fuel-efficient alternatives and rival zero-emission technologies should be allowed to compete with EVs on level terms. Ideally, an economywide tax on carbon emissions should be part of the mix. This would raise the price of gasoline and encourage consumers to buy clean-energy cars (regardless of the technology used) while driving their older, dirtier models less. Crucially, it would also promote energy efficiency more broadly and accelerate efforts to decarbonize the supply of electricity. Granted, building political support in the U.S. for a carbon tax is challenging. Until that changes, the government can still incentivize low-carbon transportation more effectively — by extending tax credits to gas-powered hybrids and imposing congestion charges on high-polluting cars in urban areas, for example. Fighting climate change requires a comprehensive and coherent strategy. EVs are part of the answer, but only part.

35,"Energy secretary announces electric vehicle grants, spotlights clean energy in Minnesota","Two Minnesota organizations, including a Native-led nonprofit, have been awarded $1.67 million each in federal dollars to make electric vehicles (EVs) more accessible to underserved communities. U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm announced the grants on her swing through the Twin Cities on Friday, spotlighting President Joe Biden's administration's Investing in America agenda. Transportation is the country's biggest polluter, Granholm said, adding that she's ""impatient"" to reach the administration's goal of 500,000 EV charging stations across the country by 2030. ""We want all, all Americans to have access to clean transportation,"" Granholm said in remarks at the St. Paul offices of the American Lung Association. Fossil-fuel-based transportation is a major source of the heat-trapping greenhouse gases driving the climate crisis. The burden of other pollutants in the exhaust, such as fine particulate matter, is heavier for nonwhite and low-income communities in the United States, according to the American Lung Association. The association, a grant recipient, will direct the money to various partners includingEV Spot NetworkandEvie Carshare, entities owned by the city of St. Paul that have deployed car-sharing EVs and charging stations in low-income areas across Minneapolis and St. Paul. The grant will fund 10 additional EV charging hubs containing 40 Level 2 charging ports on St. Paul's diverse East Side, including along the Gold Line bus rapid transit route. Neighborhood leaders will help determine the best locations for all the chargers. St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, on hand for the event, praised the effort. He said the popular car-share program ""felt like a moonshot"" when they first started talking about it a few years ago. It has grown to 2,500 trips a week, he said.Leila Navidi, Star TribuneU.S. Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, center, posed for a photo with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, left, and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter during a visit to the American Lung Association of Minnesota to announce money for local EV projects on Friday, May 19, 2023 in St. Paul, Minn. ] LEILA NAVIDI • leila.navidi@startribune.com Likewise, the grant to Native Sun Community Power Development, a Minneapolis-based Native-led nonprofit, will allow it to expand into Wisconsin and Michigan and install at least 15 new charging stations in tribal communities, including DC fast-chargers. The new grant follows $6.67 million the Energy Department awarded Native Sun in 2021 for an Upper Midwest Inter-Tribal EV Charging Community Network to serve various tribal communities, including the Red Lake Band of Chippewa in Minnesota and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in the Dakotas. During an interview, Native Sun executive director Robert Blake said the price of used Nissan Leaf EVs has come down and become affordable. This is a situation where ""if you build it they will come,"" Blake said. ""We are going to lead this transition,"" Blake said. Earlier Friday, Granholm joined Gov. Tim Walz and other leaders in a ribbon-cutting at the Cummins manufacturing campus in Fridley. The plant has started producing large hydrogen electrolyzers for the hydrogen fuel cells that power steel makers, utilities and vehicles. It's the company's first U.S. electrolyzer production facility;  Bidenvisited itin April. The equipment uses electricity to generate hydrogen by splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen. The hydrogen gas is stored for use in hydrogen fuel cells to make electricity for a range of uses. Granholm told the group gathered at Cummins — business leaders, employees, officials, lawmakers and media — that the Energy Department has been working on the technology for decades. The agency is trying to make it more competitive by bringing down the cost of clean hydrogen 80% in a decade, to $1 per kilogram. ""We believe at the Department of Energy that clean hydrogen is the Swiss army knife of zero-carbon technologies,"" Granholm said. Cummins spokesman Jon Mills said his company hasn't received federal money for the Fridley electrolyzer production, but that the 2022 federal Inflation Reduction Act has incentives to drive the purchase of U.S.-based green hydrogen. The act ""was a reason we did this,"" Mills said. Out on the production floor, manufacturing leader Shaun Crudup said he's worked at Cummins for years and is excited about the change.

36,This farm reporter roams rural Minnesota by EV — and it's no easy task,"The first time I knew our new Nissan Leaf was a dud came when I was stranded — with a nearly drained battery — in a St. Cloud parking lot, calling in on Zoom as a panelist at a turkey convention that I couldn't reach in time. These are the kinds of gigs you get invited to as an agriculture journalist in Minnesota — and meeting farmers face-to-face is a crucial part of my job in understanding the communities I cover. So I'd left our home in Minneapolis bright and early to reach Alexandria, where I had planned to join the panel. Driving our electric vehicle (EV) around Minnesota as a farm reporter over the prior two months had proven, well, adventurous. Our state does not yet have widespread adoption of electric charging infrastructure — and I've got the battle stories to prove it. America says it wants more electric vehicles. And for good reason: Gas-guzzling is an addiction that is overheating our planet. This summer, the Biden administration rankled car dealers when it called for 75% new vehicles by 2032 to not carry any internal-combustion engines. Now, after owning an EV more than six months — and using that vehicle for work as a journalist that involves predominantly driving across rural America — my personal experience suggests we're unprepared to help consumers successfully transition. One question that emerges: Will EV become the Ford Pinto, a once-hyped car that soon fell out of favor? EVs are a key part of our nation's energy transition, but the wide-open spaces of rural Minnesota present huge infrastructure hurdles. The Public Utilities Commission and outstate entities, such as Otter Tail Power, have acknowledged this to be true. But the current pace of building out stations is dampening the success. The chargers are too far apart, too few and not universally well-maintained. ZEF Energy, which runs a number of chargers in greater Minnesota, didn't return my phone call. Neither did the mayor of Sioux Falls, who rejected federal funds that would've helped build-out the city's charging infrastructure (the city currently boasts no fast-chargers for our Leaf). There is progress in pockets. Leech Lake  Band of Ojibwe's Brandy Toft, the band's environmental director, says it is building out more chargers on the reservation, which already has a fast-charger available at Northern Lights casino. ""The primary focus wasn't, 'Oh come spend your money,'"" Toft said. ""It's because I have a girlfriend who has a Leaf. She has small children. She's a single woman. The casino is brightly lit. It always has cameras. There are people there. There's food, shelter, whatever."" Still, for a lot of swaths of our state, parents may be concerned about buying a vehicle that could leave them stranded in a blizzard, trying to get their kid home from a hockey game or envisioning a late-night call for a tow truck after running out of juice after a piano recital. My close calls weren't for lack of effort. I can recite the towns with our particular breed of fast-charger: Cannon Falls, Princeton, Hudson, Wis. I've penciled out distances. Sixty miles to the charger behind the cute coffee shop in St. Peter? Can I reach the charger at Winona State or will I need to hop the Amtrak to get back home? And yet here I was on that day in St. Cloud, just 60 miles from home. I'd triple-checked my app before the morning's two-hour drive to Alexandria (our car's range clocks in at roughly 175 miles). But my battery's percentage had dropped faster than a curling stone into a lake. When I reached the fast-chargers — in Monticello and St. Cloud — one was blocked by an overnight parked car and the other didn't turn on. I was stuck. Soon, that sweaty-palmed reality gave way to plain-old embarrassment. I'd need to let the convention's organizers know I couldn't make it. Fortunately, the turkey association's president, Ashley Kohls, phoned me and asked if I could call in remotely. But I felt, nevertheless, like the real turkey. And I wish I could report my story was an anomaly as our country starts the transition to clean, emissions-free technology. But, at least for a lot of rural Americans, the EV future still feels fanciful. I remember arriving at a Land O'Lakes farm in Cannon Falls, rolling in on fumes, sucking in my gut and saying a silent prayer. I've chatted up a Ford F-150 Lightning driver from Brainerd in the Detroit Lakes liquor store parking lot about our common enemy: range anxiety. It's that same feeling as when you're about to run out of gas, but without a red pail of fuel that can bail you out. I've also heard the counterarguments. ""My son-in-law drove the Eastern Seaboard in an EV and never had to sweat it."" ""We went leaf-peeping on the North Shore in our Tesla, and the only stress we had was whether to get blueberry or coconut cream at Betty's Pies."" I don't doubt these tales. But what's conveniently missing from all of these highway adventures: Commutes. Deliveries. Children. Winter. I've yet to own our car in winter, when its efficiency drops, and already my wife prudently demands we use my parents' SUV when we travel out of town with our 16-month-old baby. We asked our friends, also owners of an EV, what they do when they travel north to a cabin in Ely. Their response: ""We just rent a car."" For now, I press on in my Leaf. On a recent evening, I headed north from Minneapolis, hoping to catch a sugar beet harvest the next morning. I needed a charge in Little Falls and pulled into a small park along the Mississippi River. When I opened my door, I was greeted by the dulcet sounds of a small brass ensemble coming from the picnic shelter. ""We play here every Tuesday night,"" an older gentleman told me, as I sat on a bench and listened to the hum of the horns — underscored quietly, rhythmically by the buzzing of my charging electric car in the parking lot.

37,Minnesota auto dealers lose court fight with state pollution regulators over 'clean car' rule,"The Minnesota Court of Appeals has upheld the state's ""clean car"" rulemaking, backing the authority of the state's pollution regulator to try to get more zero-emission vehicles onto sales lots in the fight against climate change. The decision, released Monday, is a loss for the Minnesota Automobile Dealers Association, which has been challenging the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) over the rulemaking. The industry group has characterized it as unnecessary regulatory overreach. Doug Seaton, who heads the Upper Midwest Law Center in Minneapolis and works with the auto dealers group, said they were disappointed and will likely petition the state Supreme Court to hear the case. ""We think it's the wrong decision,"" Seaton said. ""We knew from the outset this would potentially take going to the Supreme Court."" Minnesotans for Clean Cars, a coalition of environmental groups, issued a news release applauding the decision as a win. Transportation has been the state's biggest source of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, particularly with regard to passenger vehicles. Joy Anderson, supervising attorney for the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, said in the release that Minnesotans want more opportunities to buy electric vehicles, which automakers have been sending to other states with strict emissions standards.

38,2023 tax credits may boost the appeal of electric vehicles,"businessAutos ByThe Associated Press 5:38 AM on Dec 28, 2022 CST WASHINGTON — Starting Jan. 1, many Americans will qualify for a tax credit of up to $7,500 for buying an electric vehicle. The credit, part of changes enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act, is designed to spur EV sales and reduce greenhouse emissions. But a complex web of requirements, including where vehicles and batteries must be manufactured to qualify, is casting doubt on whether anyone can receive the full $7,500 credit next year. For at least the first two months of 2023, though, a delay in the Treasury Department’s rules for the new benefit will likely make the full credit temporarily available to consumers who meet certain income and price limits. The new law also provides a smaller credit for people who buy a used EV. Become a business insider with the latest news. By signing up you agree to ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy Policy Certain EV brands that were eligible for a separate tax credit that began in 2010 and that will end this year may not be eligible for the new credit. Several EV models made by Kia, Hyundai and Audi, for example, won’t qualify at all because they are manufactured outside North America. The new tax credit, which lasts until 2032, is intended to make zero-emission vehicles affordable to more people. Here is a closer look at it: The credit of up to $7,500 will be offered to people who buy certain new electric vehicles as well as some plug-in gas-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. For people who buy a used vehicle that runs on battery power, a $4,000 credit will be available. But the question of which vehicles and buyers will qualify for the credits is complicated and will remain uncertain until Treasury issues the proposed rules in March. What’s known so far is that to qualify for the credit, new EVs must be made in North America. In addition, there are caps on vehicle prices and buyer incomes that are intended to disqualify wealthier buyers. Starting in March, complex provisions will also govern battery components. Forty percent of battery minerals will have to come from North America or a country with a U.S. free trade agreement or be recycled in North America. (That threshold will eventually go to 80%.) And 50% of the battery parts will have to be made or assembled in North America, eventually rising to 100%. Starting in 2025, battery minerals cannot come from a “foreign entity of concern,” mainly China and Russia. Battery parts cannot be sourced in those countries starting in 2024 — a troublesome obstacle for the auto industry because numerous EV metals and parts now come from China. There are also battery-size requirements. Because of the many remaining uncertainties, it’s not entirely clear which vehicles are eligible. General Motors and Tesla have the most EVs assembled in North America. Each also makes batteries in the U.S. But because of the requirements for where batteries, minerals and parts must be manufactured, it’s likely that buyers of those vehicles would initially receive only half the tax credit, or $3,750. GM says its eligible EVs should qualify for the $3,750 credit by March, with the full credit available in 2025. Until Treasury issues its rules, though, the requirements governing where minerals and parts must be sourced will be waived. This will allow eligible buyers to receive the full $7,500 tax incentive for qualifying models early in 2023. The Energy Department says 29 EV and plug-in models were manufactured in North America in the 2022 and 2023 model years. They’re from Audi, BMW, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Ford, GMC, Jeep, Lincoln, Lucid, Nissan, Rivian, Tesla, Volvo, Cadillac, Mercedes and Volkswagen. Yet because of price limits or battery-size requirements, not all these vehicle models will qualify for credits. To qualify, new electric sedans cannot have a sticker price above $55,000. Pickup trucks, SUVs and vans can’t be over $80,000. This will disqualify two higher-priced Tesla models. Though Tesla’s top sellers, the models 3 and Y, will be eligible, with options, those vehicles might exceed the price limits. Kelley Blue Book says the average EV now costs over $65,000, though lower-priced models are coming. For new EVs, buyers cannot have an adjusted gross income above $150,000 if single, $300,000 if filing jointly and $225,000 if they’re head of a household. For used EVs, buyers cannot earn more than $75,000 if single, $150,000 if filing jointly and $112,500 if head of household. At first, it will be applied to your 2023 tax return, which you file in 2024. Starting in 2024, consumers can transfer the credit to a dealership to lower the vehicle price at purchase. Yes, but it will probably take a few years, said Mike Fiske, associate director for S&P Global Mobility. The credit may cause a bump in sales early next year because of Treasury’s delay in issuing the stricter requirements. But most automakers are now selling all the EVs they build and cannot make more because of shortages of parts, including computer chips. And automakers may have trouble certifying the sources of battery minerals and parts, a requirement for buyers to receive the full credit. Automakers have been scrambling to move more EV supply chains to the U.S. Consumers can receive tax credits of up to $4,000 — or 30% of the vehicle price, whichever is less — for buying EVs that are at least two years old. But the used EV must cost less than $25,000 — a tall order given the starting prices for most EVs on the market. A search onAutotrader.comshows that the Chevy Bolt, the Nissan Leaf and other relatively economical used EVs are listed at $26,000 or more for models dating back to 2019. On the other hand, used EVs don’t have to be made in North America or comply with the battery-sourcing requirements. That means that, for instance, a 2022 Kia EV6 that’s ineligible for the new-vehicle credit because it’s made in South Korea can qualify for a used-car credit if its price falls below $25,000. “The real effects where these tax credits will have a big impact will be in the 2026 to 2032 period — a few years into the future — as automakers gear up and volumes increase,” said Chris Harto, a senior policy analyst forConsumer Reports. The credits are part of roughly $370 billion in spending on clean energy — America’s largest investment to fight climate change — that was signed into law in August by President Joe Biden. EVs make up about 5% of U.S. new-vehicle sales; Biden has set a goal of 50% by 2030. Sales of EVs have been climbing, particularly as California and other states have moved to phase out gas-powered cars. The rise of lower-cost competitors to Tesla, such as the Chevy Equinox, with an expected base price of around $30,000, are expected to broaden the EVs’ reach to middle-class households. S&P Global Mobility expects EVs’ share of auto sales to reach 8% next year, 15% by 2025 and 37% by 2030. That’s not clear yet. Some U.S. allies are upset over North American manufacturing requirements that disqualify EVs made in Europe or South Korea. The requirements knock Hyundai and Kia out of the credits, at least in the short term. They plan to build new EV and battery plants in Georgia, but those won’t open until 2025. European Union countries fear that the tax credits could make their automakers move factories to the U.S. The Treasury Department said it would release information by year’s end on the “anticipated direction” of the battery sourcing and mineral requirements. A loosening of rules to address U.S. allies’ concerns would make more EVs eligible. But it also risks extending U.S. reliance on foreign supply chains. If you install an EV charger at home, credits may be available. The new law revives a federal tax credit that had expired in 2021; it provides 30% of the cost of hardware and installation, up to $1,000. It adds a requirement that the charger must be in a low-income or non-urban area. Businesses that install new EV chargers in those areas can receive tax credits of as much as 30% — up to $100,000 per charger. Residential EV chargers can range in cost from $200 to $1,000; installation can add several more hundred dollars. That’s entirely a personal decision. If you’ve grown tired of volatile gasoline prices and are considering an EV, you might want to go ahead. Buying a qualifying EV in January or February could net you the full $7,500 tax break before more stringent requirements take effect in March. Additional state credits also may be available. But if you’re still on the fence, there’s no urgency. Consumers who rush to buy now, when relatively few qualifying EVs are available, may face dealer price markups. Within a few years, technology will improve, and more EVs will qualify for full credits.

39,Are electric vehicles the future? Here’s what State Fair of Texas visitors are saying,"News ByNoor Adatia 8:00 AM on Oct 8, 2022 CDT Among its usual lineup of cars, trucks and SUVs, this year’s auto show at the State Fair of Texas features nearly a dozen electric vehicles, and fairgoers have been eager to check out the vehicles that could replace their gas-powered cars down the road. With more federal dollars going toward EV infrastructure, interest in electric vehicles has gained traction among consumers who drive gas-powered cars — and more options are becoming available to buyers. Over the next five years, Texas plans to build more than 50 charging stations across the state’s highways,using part of the $408 million in federal money approved last week. And the recent passage of the federalInflation Reduction Actprovides many buyers with tax incentives of up to $7,500 for newly purchased EVs whose component parts are manufactured and assembled in the U.S. The bill also lifts a cap of 200,000 vehicles that can receive tax credits, providing incentive for automakers to produce more cars. Get the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond. By signing up you agree to ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy Policy With the promise of more infrastructure and investments down the road, some fairgoers at the auto show expressed interest in buying an electric vehicle in the future. Garland resident Cory Woodward said Friday he has been looking at EVs for their advanced technology. “Electric is going to be the future; maybe not necessarily so fast, but it will be, so I think they’re cool,” said Woodward, who has ordered a 2022 Ford Mustang Mach E but is on the fence about going through with the purchase. “I think they’re overpriced right now as is, but we’re probably two to three years before most of them become reasonable,” he said. Woodward added that there are some reasonably priced electric vehicles on the market but the Mustang Mach E — which starts around $44,000 — isn’t one of them. “There are some reasonable ones out there, but this one is not.” Auto show visitor Azumi Park agreed that EVs tend to be pricey but expects that will change as cars with gasoline engines are phased out. “I think it’s maybe going to go down when they make a transition eventually, so that’s when I’m trying to buy one probably,” she said. Fairgoer Nick Hansen said he’s in the market for an electric vehicle primarily because they require less maintenance than gas vehicles — but he doesn’t think the prices make financial sense. “Right now it’s just not economical with the pricing; you’re better off buying a gas car and paying for gas,” he said. Tesla is far from the only automaker in the electrical vehicle game these days, and some manufacturers are making their debut in the EV scene this year.

40,"Only 10 electric vehicles will qualify for $7,500 tax credit","businessAutos ByThe Associated Press 1:38 PM on Apr 17, 2023 CDT Ten electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles will be eligible for a $7,500 U.S. tax credit, while another seven could get $3,750 under new federal rules that go into effect on Tuesday. But under the Treasury Department rules and other provisions of last year’s Inflation Reduction Act, most of the more than 60 electric or plug-in hybrids on sale in the U.S. won’t get any tax credits. That could slow acceptance of electric vehicles and could delay reaching President Joe Biden’s ambitious goal that half of new passenger vehicles sold in the U.S. run on electricity by 2030. The new rules, which govern how much battery minerals and parts can come from countries that don’t have free trade agreements with the U.S., bumped nine vehicles off the tax credit eligibility list that went into effect Jan. 1. Become a business insider with the latest news. By signing up you agree to ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy Policy The 10 vehicles eligible for the full $7,500 credit are: The seven models that could get a $3,750 credit include the Jeep Wrangler and Grand Cherokee plug-ins, Ford’s Mustang Mach-E SUV, Escape plug-in and E-Transit electric van, the Lincoln Corsair Grand Touring plug-in and the standard range rear-wheel-drive version of Tesla’s Model 3. Consumers can check to see if the EV they’re considering is eligible for a credit atwww.fueleconomy.gov. To be eligible, electric vehicles or plug-ins have to be manufactured in North America. SUVs, vans and trucks can’t have a sticker price greater than $80,000, while cars can’t sticker for more than $55,000. There also are income limits for buyers. The Treasury Department says the new list shows that families who want to buy an electric or plug-in vehicle “will continue to have a number of options to receive a full or partial tax credit in the near term” under rules designed to build electric vehicle production and a supply chain in the U.S. The reduction in eligible EVs also could conflict with the administration’s proposed strict new automobile pollution limits announced last week. The new standards would require up to two-thirds of new vehicles sold in the U.S. to be electric by 2032. That’s a nearly tenfold increase over current electric vehicle sales. Many of the vehicles that aren’t eligible for the credit are made outside of North America, but their manufacturers are building assembly and battery plants in the U.S., and more vehicles will become eligible. Some auto industry analysts say that while $7,500 would be enough to entice people away from internal combustion vehicles, a $3,750 tax credit might not be enough to offset the average U.S. new EV price. Kelley Blue Book says the average U.S. new EV costs about $58,600, nearly $10,000 more than the average new vehicle price. To be sure, average EV prices are falling as more people buy less-expensive models. The average EV price was $63,500 a year ago. Jeff Schuster, executive vice president of LMC Automotive and Global Data, said half of the full tax credit isn’t enough. “You’re shrinking the market essentially by the vehicles not being affordable,” he said, adding that the average combustion engine vehicle isn’t affordable either. The big issue in the rules that are effective Tuesday are limits on the percentage of battery parts and minerals that come from countries that don’t have free trade or mineral agreements with the United States. This year, at least 40% of the value of battery minerals must be mined, processed or recycled in the U.S. or countries with which it has trade deals. That rises 10% every year until it hits 80% after 2026. Also, at least 50% of the value of battery parts must be manufactured or assembled in North America this year. That requirement rises to 60% next year and in 2025 and jumps 10% each year until it hits 100% after 2028. In addition to the price limits, there also are income limits aimed to stop wealthier people from getting credits. Buyers cannot have an adjusted gross annual income above $150,000 if single, $300,000 if filing jointly and $225,000 if head of a household. In addition, starting in 2025, battery minerals cannot come from a “foreign entity of concern,” mainly China and Russia. Battery parts cannot be sourced in those countries starting in 2024; minerals can’t come from those countries in 2025. The Biden administration said rules governing that requirement are in the works. Even though the rules are effective Tuesday, the Biden administration is taking public comments, and they can be modified later, including the addition of countries that negotiate trade agreements with the U.S. Tom Krisher, Associated Press The Associated Press",dallasnews,mid-west,businessautos bythe associated press 138 pm apr 17 2023 cdt ten electric plugin hybrid vehicles eligible 7500 yous tax credit another seven could get 3750 new federal rules go effect tuesday treasury department rules provisions last years inflation reduction act 60 electric plugin hybrids sale yous get tax credits could slow acceptance electric vehicles could delay reaching president joe bidens ambitious goal half new passenger vehicles sold yous run electricity 2030 new rules govern much battery minerals parts come countries free trade agreements yous bumped nine vehicles tax credit eligibility list went effect january 1 become business insider latest news signing agree ourterms serviceandprivacy policy 10 vehicles eligible full 7500 credit seven models could get 3750 credit include jeep wrangler grand cherokee plugins fords mustang mache suv escape plugin etransit electric van lincoln corsair grand touring plugin standard range rearwheeldrive version teslas model 3 consumers check see ev considering eligible credit eligible electric vehicles plugins manufactured north america suvs vans trucks sticker price greater 80000 cars sticker 55000 also income limits buyers treasury department says new list shows families want buy electric plugin vehicle continue number options receive full partial tax credit near term rules designed build electric vehicle production supply chain yous reduction eligible evs also could conflict administrations proposed strict new automobile pollution limits announced last week new standards would require twothirds new vehicles sold yous electric 2032 nearly tenfold increase current electric vehicle sales many vehicles eligible credit made outside north america manufacturers building assembly battery plants yous vehicles become eligible auto industry analysts say 7500 would enough entice people away internal combustion vehicles 3750 tax credit might enough offset average yous new ev price kelley blue book says average yous new ev costs 58600 nearly 10000 average new vehicle price sure average ev prices falling people buy lessexpensive models average ev price 63500 year ago jeff schuster executive vice president lmc automotive global data said half full tax credit enough shrinking market essentially vehicles affordable said adding average combustion engine vehicle affordable either big issue rules effective tuesday limits percentage battery parts minerals come countries free trade mineral agreements united states year least 40 value battery minerals must mined processed recycled yous countries trade deals rises 10 every year hits 80 2026 also least 50 value battery parts must manufactured assembled north america year requirement rises 60 next year 2025 jumps 10 year hits 100 2028 addition price limits also income limits aimed stop wealthier people getting credits buyers adjusted gross annual income 150000 single 300000 filing jointly 225000 head household addition starting 2025 battery minerals come foreign entity concern mainly china russia battery parts sourced countries starting 2024 minerals come countries 2025 biden administration said rules governing requirement works even though rules effective tuesday biden administration taking public comments modified later including addition countries negotiate trade agreements yous tom krisher associated press associated press,04-17-2023,2023,"[('138 pm', 'QUANTITY'), ('17 2023', 'DATE'), ('ten', 'CARDINAL'), ('7500', 'CARDINAL'), ('seven', 'CARDINAL'), ('3750', 'CARDINAL'), ('tuesday', 'DATE'), ('treasury department', 'ORG'), ('last years', 'DATE'), ('60', 'CARDINAL'), ('joe bidens', 'PERSON'), ('half', 'CARDINAL'), ('2030', 'DATE'), ('nine', 'CARDINAL'), ('january 1', 'DATE'), ('10', 'CARDINAL'), ('7500', 'CARDINAL'), ('seven', 'CARDINAL'), ('3750', 'CARDINAL'), ('cherokee', 'CARDINAL'), ('mustang mache', 'PERSON'), ('electric van lincoln', 'ORG'), ('3', 'CARDINAL'), ('north america', 'LOC'), ('80000', 'CARDINAL'), ('55000', 'CARDINAL'), ('last week', 'DATE'), ('2032', 'DATE'), ('north america', 'LOC'), ('7500', 'CARDINAL'), ('3750', 'CARDINAL'), ('63500 year ago', 'DATE'), ('jeff', 'PERSON'), ('half', 'CARDINAL'), ('tuesday', 'DATE'), ('year least 40', 'CARDINAL'), ('10 every year', 'DATE'), ('80 2026', 'DATE'), ('50', 'CARDINAL'), ('north america', 'LOC'), ('60 next year 2025', 'DATE'), ('10 year', 'DATE'), ('100 2028', 'CARDINAL'), ('annual', 'DATE'), ('150000', 'CARDINAL'), ('300000', 'CARDINAL'), ('225000', 'CARDINAL'), ('2025', 'CARDINAL'), ('china', 'GPE'), ('russia', 'GPE'), ('2024', 'CARDINAL'), ('2025', 'DATE'), ('tuesday', 'DATE'), ('tom krisher', 'PERSON')]"
41,New Texas laws aimed at sharp rise in electric vehicle ownership in Lone Star State,"newsPolitics ByAarón Torres 6:00 AM on Jul 3, 2023 CDT AUSTIN — Texans are known for their long road trips, and gas stations dot the state’s highways to keep them driving, but drivers in electric vehicles may experience something else: “range anxiety.” Texas lags other states in adopting EVs, and lacks essential charging stations needed to keep the electric engines powered. But as Tesla, Ford and Rivian increase mass production of electric vehicles, lawmakers are trying to lay the groundwork for easier adoption. In the Legislature’s regular session that ended May 29, EV advocates successfully nudged several bills to passage — not all they wanted, but enough, they say, to keep momentum going for an essential ingredient: more charging stations. “When you look at reasons people don’t buy electric vehicles, No. 1 is cost, and that’s changing rapidly” and decreasing, said Tom “Smitty” Smith, executive director of the Texas Electric Transportation Resources Alliance, and an electric vehicle owner. “The No. 2 [reason] is charging access or range anxiety.” Get the latest politics news from North Texas and beyond. By signing up you agree to ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy Policy The number of gas stations in Texas dwarfs the number of available chargers. There are more than 12,000 devices — or pumps — in the Lone Star State from which one can fuel up a gas-powered car. Meanwhile, there are only about 2,900 charging stations in Texas. There are about 18.7 charging stations per 100,000 residents, putting Texas 36th among states, according todata by the software company CoPilot.Vermont and California rank No. 1 and 2, respectively, and the top 10 states have at least 55 charging stations per 100,000 residents. But new laws signed by Gov. Greg Abbott will help fast-track development of more charging stations as electric vehicle ownership increases. One law — Senate Bill 1001 — also increases transparency by displaying the cost to use a charger before charging and creates a process for the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation to inspect the chargers — similar to how it inspects gas stations. Another — Senate Bill 1002 — ensures that utility companies can’t undercut private retailers and other businesses that offer charging stations by offering charging at a lower rate. Advocates say the measure is vital to building out a network of charging stations. The presence of more charges is particularly important to electric vehicle owners who are unable to charge their vehicles at home. Neal Farris, an electric vehicle owner in Dallas and vice president of the North Texas Electric Vehicle Auto Association, owns an electric BMW i3. He charges at home and said he has rarely used a public charger. He believes charging stations will be less important as more gas stations offer chargers. “Those destination charge stations are going to become irrelevant over time,” Farris said. But that future is likely to be decades away. There are more than 202,800 electric vehicles registered in Texas, according to Texas Department of Transportation data compiled by the Dallas Fort Worth-Clean Cities Coalition. As of 2021, there were more than 20 million gasoline-powered vehicles registered in the state,according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The federal government under President Joe Biden has hoped to incentivize purchasing electric vehicles, which are seen as a cleaner fuel source that will cut down on emissions. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 gave Texas $400 million in federal funds. The state has said it plans to use that money to build more than 50 new charging stations along state highways. TxDOT aims to have a charging station every 50 to 70 miles, according toa plan released in 2022,and will award contracts  to build those stations. No contracts have been awarded yet, a department spokesman said. The plan does not set a time frame for completing the stations. Some say the shift to electric vehicles raises equity questions. Research has shown that the average owner of an electric vehicle tends to be white and college-educated, living in a single-family home. The average price of a new electric vehicle in May was $55,488,according to Kelly Blue Book. Car companies hope to help bridge the gap in electric vehicle ownership among demographic groups. General Motors has announced plan to make electric vehicles for everyone. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Austin-based Tesla, has repeatedly touted the idea ofproducing a Tesla that sells for $25,000. “I think they’re going to take a more practical profile here pretty quickly,” said state Sen. Nathan Johnson, D-Dallas. “If we’re going to see an electric vehicle adoption on a large scale beyond the novelty and luxury level that it presently occupies, we are going to need serious build-out of that infrastructure here.” Aarón Torres, Austin Bureau Correspondent.

42,How electric vehicles can help cities like Houston fight climate change,"Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner was one ofmore than 300 mayorswho departed from President Donald Trump's decision to exit the Paris climate agreement. And this departure reaffirmed what was already clear: The federal government is no longer leading American efforts to shrink our carbon footprint. In fact, Houston is just one of many local and state governments –along with businessesand consumers– aiming to help fill this policy void. At least a dozen governors have joined theUnited States Climate Alliance, committing their states to achieve emissions reductions consistent with President Barack Obama’s Paris pledge. My researchwith my former studentShayak Senguptaabout how cities like Houston can benefit from buying electric cars suggests that fuel-free municipal fleets can cut urban carbon footprints while improvingpublic healthand saving taxpayers money. Here's a map of the 12 states, 1 territory and 211 cities committed to the Paris Agreement targets (as of 5pm EDT). 125 million people.pic.twitter.com/YfRexyWvbi  Options for states and cities States can help curb emissions in many ways, such as bysetting capson power plant emissions andcreating incentives and targetsfor renewable electricity. Most of those steps lies beyond the jurisdiction of cities. So how can they take climate action? Urban governments most strongly impact emissions byinfluencing the behaviorof local residents and businesses through building codes and incentives, public transit and urban planning. Buyingincreasingly affordableelectric vehicles gives cities an additional opportunity to cutclimate-warming emissionsby reducing the amount of fossil fuels their vehicles consume. Historically, cities and transit agencies turned tonatural gasas an alternative fuel for fleet vehicles and buses. However, ourprevious researchshowed that natural gas does not provide significant emissions savings compared with gasoline cars or diesel buses. Electric vehicles, however, can bring about clear-cut reductions in carbon emissions.  The electric vehicle market U.S. cities own few of the540,000 electric carson the road nationwide as of 2016. The nation’s two largest cities,New York CityandLos Angeles, operate 1,000 and 200 electric cars, respectively. That could soon change. Thirty cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston,are seeking bulk-rate dealson electric vehicles. They’ve asked manufacturers to submit bids to supply up to 114,000 electric vehicles, ranging from police cruisers to trash haulers, at a totalcost of roughly $10 billion. This surge in electric vehicle sales could make them more affordable — not just for cities but for the rest of us, too. That’s because emerging technologies typically get cheaper as production increases. A study by researchers from theStockholm Environment Instituteestimates that electric car batteries prices fall by 6 percent to 9 percentevery time production doubles. Someanalystsforecastthat as soon as 2025, electric cars will become cheaper than gasoline-powered cars. In some cases, they are already cheaper to own and operate over the vehicle’s lifetime,our researchhas shown. If cities help ramp up demand for electric cars faster than anticipated, this transition could happen even faster.  Municipal fleets City-owned fleets are in some ways ideal candidates for electric-powered transportation. Cities operate large numbers of vehicles in densely populated areas, where emissions most endangerhuman health. Local driving by municipal employees is well-suited for electric cars. For example, the Nissan Leaf now has a range of as much as107 miles, and the Chevy Bolt can travel238 mileswithout recharging. Meanwhile, electric models of pickup trucks, dump trucks, buses and police cruisers are becomingincreasingly available.  Houston's vehicles We studiedvehicle options available  to Houston, whichoperates a fleetof about 12,000 vehicles, in 2015. Those options included two gasoline-powered Toyota sedans (the Corolla and the Prius), the natural gas-powered Honda Civic, the plug-in hybrid Toyota Prius and the fully electric Nissan Leaf. Since all these sedans seat five passengers, they are interchangeable. Because Houston in 2015 bought 75 percent of its electricity from wind farms (it now drawseven more of its power from wind and solarsources),we calculatedthat the fully electric Leaf would have reduced life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 87 percent relative to the gasoline-powered Corolla over seven years. About half of those benefits would have been lost if the Leaf was charged from the fossil-heavy gridelsewhere in Texas. Financially, the savings on fuel and maintenance would have more than offset the $12,000 premium for buying a Leaf instead of a Corolla. We estimated that Houston would have saved about $.0.04 per mile while operating the Leafs, as long as enough charging stations were available. That’s even before counting any savings from bulk purchases orfederal tax credits. Now that the City has negotiated itsnew solar deal, it'sleading all cities in renewable power purchasesand getting 89 percent of its power from renewables. So, electric vehicles today would cut emissions even more than at the time of our study.  Charging stations One significant problem holding back demand for electric vehicles is the shortage of charging stations. Greater availability of charging stations assures cities and consumers that full electrics like the Nissan Leaf can complete their trips, and lets plug-in hybrids like the Chevy Volt operate mostly in electric mode. That’s whycities like Pittsburghhave obtained state grants to build their own, whileutilities in SeattleandKansas Cityare building charging stations to jump-start demand for electric cars. Electric municipal fleets won’t by themselves propel cities all the way to their Paris-based pledges. But by speeding the adoption of charging stations and cleaner cars, they could help curb emissions – while saving money for urban taxpayers and improving public health.

43,Opinion: Electric vehicles are no silver bullet,"Regarding ""Tomlinson: GM’s new Hummer and other EVs pose challenge to Elon Musk and Texas's oil industry,"" (Jan. 16): Tomlinson breezily dismisses any stress on the Texas grid that an increase in EVs would create by stating that people would charge their cars at night. However, this is precisely when energy derived from both wind and solar can be at their lowest. Clearly, solar energy is at a minimum when the sun goes down but so can wind. Wind speed over landtends to decrease during the nightwhen the ground is not heated by the sun. Grid storage batteries deplete in two to four hours depending on power usage and the cost can be prohibitive. One popular grid storage battery, the Tesla Megapack, costs$691,369.23 per megawatt hour. Furthermore, Gillingham and others at Yale document that, using today’s prices for coal and hydrocarbons, widespread adoption of electric carsmay actually increase CO2 emissions. They note that for EVs to have a positive effect on CO2 emissions, it would require large increases in the cost of fossil fuel energy in the form of carbon taxes. This wouldlikely greatly affect the nation’s poorand make our products far less competitive in global markets. That would work to the great benefit of China, where51.7 percentof the world's coal is burned and where they are currently building33 gigawatts of coal-based power generation, three times more than the rest of the world combined. Jory A. Pacht, Houston Here he goes again. Chris Tomlinson's column once again extols the virtues of EVs, and how they will replace the internal combustion engine. Maybe I did not read clearly enough, however I did not read where he states how long it takes to charge an electric vehicle. Other reading in the Wall Street Journal tells meit takes 20 minutes or more to recharge, on average, with a high-powered DC fast charger. Imagine waiting 30 minutes to recharge your EV when it is 95 degrees outside with 90 percent humidity in Houston. Sounds like great fun! And you'll get 300 miles — whoopee! Many of us drive that in one day. What about the price? I have also readEVs cost, on average, $66,000. That seems affordable to those households making over $200,000 per year, which is6.7 percent of American consumers. Sounds very affordable to so many, correct? Oh, and lastly, Tomlinson states that the vehicles may be charged at night. I see videos online of thosevehicles exploding in flames, and I don’t think they are photoshopped. I still can’t wait until I get mine! Tom Miltenberger, Missouri City In 2020, some276 million vehicleswere registered in the United States. As of 2020, there areover a million EVson U.S. roads. They all need charging stations that should be powered by fossil fuels, some wind and solar with some nuclear energy mixed in. Factor in the EVs that are made and used by Peterbuilt, Mack, Union Pacific, Boeing, Air Force One, the military (such as the M1 Abrams gas turbine main battle tank), container ships coming to the port of Houston, so on. Are we kidding ourselves? We will need that gas, diesel and Jet A fuel for a long time. George Gould, LaMarque Regarding ""Wind and solar boom set to go into high gear,"" (Dec. 30): With more use of clean energy being the bandwagon of the moment, the growing use of solar farms in Texas is a concern to me. We love the touted open spaces yet we cheer the growth of solar farms, which encroach on the open spaces. Why not use all the roofs of urban area buildings for these farms? Are we missing an opportunity? John Kolodczak, Newark, Del. (with Texas roots in Plantersville) Regarding ""Economic woes, war, climate change on tap for Davos meeting,"" (Jan. 16): I was watching the recent World Economic Forum, and was astounded by the hypocrisy that abounds. There were 2,000 plus participants,half of which arrived in private jetsbut espoused saving the environment with their green energy proposals. Then they want to keep everyone from eating meat, but have huge plates of beef and other meats served atexpensive dinners. Could these people be any more hypocritical? The world would be better served if they gave their money to those countries in need, rather than working towards restricting them from using the fossil fuels they need for their betterment. Maybe those at the WEF are naive, but I think that they all have an ulterior motive. Look at the companies that both Al Gore and John Kerry benefit from. They have become uber-rich from their ecological proselytizing. And yes, they do fly around in some really nice private jets. But I guess that is OK so long as you talk the good talk.

44,"Nearly half of U.S. car buyers plan to go electric in next two years, report finds","Analysts at Ernst and Young surveyed 1,500 U.S. consumers in March and found that 48 percent of vehicle buyers plan to purchase an EV – representing a nearly 20 percent jump from last year’s survey. Nearly half of U.S. consumers who plan to buy a car in the next two years say they’ll go electric, according to a new report from consulting firm Ernst and Young. Analysts atErnst and Young surveyed 1,500 U.S. consumersin March and found that 48 percent of vehicle buyers plan to purchase an EV – representing a nearly 20 percent jump from last year’s survey. Texas is already one of the fastest growing states for EV adoption, recently hitting200,000 electric vehicle registrations in the state, according to an analysis from Dallas-Fort Worth Clean Cities. Houston drivers account for nearly a quarter of EV registrations in the states. EV ROAD TRIPS:See how Tesla and other popular models perform on a Texas road trip Despite enthusiasm for EVs among buyers, concerns about access to charging stations persists. Just over half of U.S. consumers surveyed by Ernst and Young said they were concerned about finding charging stations. “Consumers need access to safe, reliable, convenient and affordable charging to drive and own an EV, and our research shows real concerns remain,” Marc Coltelli, Americas leader of electric mobility at Ernst and Young, said in a statement. “To scale adoption, the challenge confronting America’s transition to EVs is instilling charging confidence among consumers.” In the recent Texas legislative session, lawmakers passed two measures,Senate Bills 1001 and 1002, aimed at increasing charging stations in the state. Already charging stations have been popping up at major grocery stores and gas stations. MORE ON EVs:The Houston Chronicle’s EV Buyer’s Guide Moving away from gasoline powered cars to electric vehicles is a major pillar in fighting climate change. Around28 percent of  greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. come from transportation, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. But electricity experts say upgrades must be made to the power grid so it can support the additional use. University of Houston Energy Fellow Ed Hirs said for the moment the Texas grid can handle the number of EVs on the road, but if the rate of EV adoption continues to increase – which Hirs said he expects – then it will change the characteristics of electricity demand on the grid. “We ordinarily see demand fall off during the evening hours,” Hirs said. “I’m expecting that over time we will see the demand begin to (rise) incrementally at night due to the addition of home charging.” Hirs said more utility scale batteries, which are currently negligible butgrowing rapidly in Texas, will likely help balance that demand.
