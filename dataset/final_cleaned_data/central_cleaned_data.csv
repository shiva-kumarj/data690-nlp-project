0,Electric vehicle charging stations could be boost for small towns along Illinois highways,"
I have owned and driven an electric vehicle exclusively for almost two years. My experience says that while the electric charging station infrastructure in Chicago and the suburbs is okay, our state really falls down once you start driving south and west. Given that the majority of electric vehicle owners charge their vehicles at home, the real robust need for charging stations is away from major population centers.Along the state’s highways, there is great room for improvement. Lawmakers need to understand that installing a Level 3 charger draws someone to their community for longer than a quick fill-up. Electric vehicle owners often plan meals and shopping around their stops. This can be a business magnet for any community that installs the equipment.Don Anderson, Oak Park

Magical new worries about deficitIn a letter on Monday, a Sun-Times reader argued that President Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan is fiscally irresponsible. But the same reader has previous argued that President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cut was wonderful. That tax cut did not deliver the “four, five, six percent” growth that Trump had promised, but it did add $1 trillion a year to the federal deficit. So when a tax cut mostly benefits corporations and the wealthiest among us, there is no need to worry about the debt? But when there is an infrastructure plan that would benefit all of us, then the debt becomes all-important?  Kevin Coughlin, Evanston

1,"Pritzker signs electric vehicle legislation, aims to make Illinois a leader in ‘clean transportation revolution’","
Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday signed legislation aimed at drawing electric vehicle manufacturers to the state, a law he said will help Illinois usher in an era of “electric school buses, electric municipal buses, electric delivery trucks, electric 18-wheelers and so much more.”“With this new focus on electric vehicles, our state can also become a leader in the clean transportation revolution,” Pritzker said at the bill signing in Rockford Tuesday morning.The Reimagining Electric Vehicles in Illinois Act provides incentives for electric vehicle production across Illinois to help reach a 2030 goal of putting one million electric cars on the road.

The new law includes tax credits and exemptions for electric vehicle manufacturers and projects ranging from income tax withholding to credits for training costs and allowing local jurisdictions to ease property taxes for projects focused on electric-powered cars.The legislation also offers incentives for employers to locate their facilities in communities that have faced disinvestment historically. Pritzker said the act is intended to attract more electric vehicle makers, charging stations  and automotive parts manufacturers helping Illinois “become one of the leading [electric vehicle] hubs in the entire nation.”“Not only can we lead in the fight against climate change, we can also create thousands of jobs for hardworking Illinoisans in the process,” Pritzker said. “The Reimagining Electric Vehicles Act is about acknowledging that there doesn’t need to be a trade-off between a cleaner environment and more jobs. We can do both, and today we take a giant leap forward in that quest.”
During his trip overseas for the U.N.’s climate conference, Pritzker told the Chicago Sun-Times last week he had two goals: Tout the electric vehicle incentive legislation and meet with companies and business leaders in the industry to attract them to Illinois.Pritzker said the state’s location, workforce, transportation system — namely being a hub for major railroads — make Illinois “one of the most attractive in the country” for electric vehicle makers and the governor felt he and his team were “successful in planting seeds.”The law Pritzker signed Tuesday follows the Legislature’s passage of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act in September. That legislation, which overhauls the state’s energy sector, puts Illinois on a path to 100% clean energy by 2050 through a mix of providing subsidies to nuclear plants and setting closure timelines for coal and natural gas firing facilities among other things.

The subsidies include nearly $700 million over five years to Exelon nuclear plants. Municipal coal-burning plants — such as Prairie State and Springfield’s City Water, Light and Power — must cut their emissions by 45% by 2035 before closing 10 years later unless they can generate green hydrogen or use similar technology to get to zero carbon emissions.At the signing of the climate and jobs act, Pritzker said that law helps the state do everything it can “to fight, to stop, and even reverse, the damage that’s been done to our climate. “As of today, Illinois is a force for good, for an environmental future we can be proud of,” Pritzker said.

2,Illinois is sitting on millions that could be spent to promote electric cars and cleaner air,"
Illinois has an electric vehicle chicken-and-egg problem. More people and government agencies would use electric vehicles if there were more charging stations, and there would be a better argument for building more charging stations if more people and government agencies used electric vehicles.Fortunately, a big wad of cash is sitting largely untouched in a state fund that could be used to resolve the conundrum, and it would be perfectly appropriate to do so. The state should spend the funds to help jump-start its electric vehicle conversion agenda.

In 2016 and 2017, Illinois received $108 million from Volkswagen as part of a nationwide resolution of legal claims against the automaker, which had been caught secretly installing software on diesel cars to cheat the system and pass air quality tests. Of that money, $89 million still sits in the state’s Volkswagen Environmental Mitigation Trust fund.We can’t think of a better use for those funds than to speed up the state’s conversion to electric vehicles. Conventional trucks and cars have surpassed power plants as the prime source of the greenhouse gases that are overheating the planet.At the same time, given that the power for electric vehicles ultimately comes from power plants, Illinois must do more to convert to sources of renewable energy, such as wind and solar. The Volkswagen money sits largely unspent because the original plan for the fund, drawn up by the Rauner administration, emphasized the continued use of fossil fuels, such as replacing old diesel engines with newer ones. The plan should have been revised when Rauner left office, but it has not.We need a new plan now.The money from the Volkswagen trust could be coupled with about $70 million set aside for vehicle electrification in Illinois’ 2019 capital bill — money that also has been just sitting around. That money is earmarked for installing electric charging stations in low-income areas and electrifying public transit, but none of the funds has been spent in two years.

Additional money might also soon be available. The Clean Energy Jobs Act, which remains stalled in the Legislature, includes more than $700 million for transportation electrification, including public vehicles, school buses and charging infrastructure where the private sector has failed to provide it. President Joe Biden’s proposed $2 trillion infrastructure bill includes money for electric vehicle charging stations, retooling factories, credits for those who buy electric vehicles and electrifying the federal fleet. Time will tell how much of that funding comes through, but Gov. J.B. Pritzker — who says he wants to see 750,000 electric vehicles on Illinois roads by the year 2030 — has no reason to wait. By tapping those Volkswagen funds, he could do more right now to achieve that goal.Send letters to letters@suntimes.com.

3,Bring electric vehicle manufacturing to Illinois to help spark our economy,"
As some corporate headquarters decamp for other states, Gov. J.B. Pritzker needs to come through on his effort to make the state a center of electric vehicle manufacturing.Last week, freight car company TTX announced it is moving its headquarters to North Carolina. That follows headquarters departures last year by Boeing, Caterpillar, Citadel Securities and Highland Ventures. Also, Tyson Foods announced last year it would move jobs from Chicago to Arkansas. In decisions affecting fewer employees, other companies have moved in or out of Illinois or expanded or reduced their footprints.In Britain last week, Pritzker led a trade mission to ask companies that supply parts for electric vehicles to see Illinois as a good place to do business. The governor has said he wants to make Illinois a center of electric vehicle manufacturing, and he has been in talks to lure a major electric vehicle battery plant.

That would not only bring jobs to the state but also help Illinois meet Pritzker’s goal of 1 million electric vehicles on Illinois roads by 2030, as well as help offset revenue lost as other jobs have left the state.

In 2021, Lion Electric opened an electric bus manufacturing plant in Joliet. In 2019, Rivian Automotive moved into a former Mitsubishi plant in Normal to start building electric vehicles. But Illinois needs to build on those successes if it is to become an electric vehicle manufacturing center.

Where there’s smoke, fire up efforts to make air cleaner



To help get there, the Legislature in 2021 passed the Reimagining Energy and Vehicles in Illinois Act, which provides incentives to lure companies in the electric vehicle supply chain and promote renewable energy. Another law passed last year will require new or renovated homes to have conduits to charge electric vehicles.Moreover, the federal Inflation Reduction Act and the National Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provide incentives for electric vehicles, and in January, Pritzker signed a bill setting out requirements for electric vehicle parking spaces.
But Illinois ought to do more to boost the market for electric vehicles. In its latest budget, the state trimmed about $7.3 million from its electric vehicle rebate program, cutting it to about $12 million. In the previous year, $19.3 million was available for the rebates, which give $4,000 to customers who buy new or used EVs from licensed dealers. Demand was so high, the program ran out of money about halfway through the fiscal year.More money should be made available for rebates, though perhaps better targeted, to avoid them going to people buying top-end models who could afford to buy electric cars without rebates.Illinois also should adopt the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, to phase out most gasoline-powered heavy-duty trucks and step up the efforts to get more electricity-powered vehicles on the roads.It also should raise emission standards, as some other states have done, including Minnesota in the Midwest, which would have the effect of requiring national auto manufacturers to sell a higher percentage of electric vehicles in Illinois, helping to create a bigger market here.

Manufacturing electric vehicles is a growth market. Nationally, EV sales are on a pace to top 1 million this year, a milestone, and sales were up in the second quarter by 50% over the same time last year, although there are signs that demand is not keeping up with production as fewer models qualify for federal tax credits.Seeing corporate jobs leaving Illinois is not a good trend. But the nation’s major auto manufacturers are committed to building more electric vehicles, and Pritzker can help offset the loss of corporate jobs if he succeeds in bringing a healthy chunk of those electric vehicle jobs to Illinois.The Sun-Times welcomes letters to the editor and op-eds. See our guidelines.Send letters to letters@suntimes.com.

4,EVs are only part of the solution,"Arresting climate change requires, among other things, the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. But managing the transition from gas-powered cars won't be easy. President Joe Biden's administration has proposed new rules to sharply limit tailpipe emissions, with the aim of compelling automakers to devote at least two-thirds of new sales to EVs within the next decade. For this policy to work, the government will have to get a lot of other things right. The logic behind the plan is straightforward: To eliminate carbon emissions by 2050, the U.S. needs to slash pollution from cars and trucks. Getting more electric vehicles on the road will help. But without supporting policies, EVs are unlikely to cut carbon emissions as much as advocates envision. Policymakers owe the public an honest accounting of costs and benefits. Worldwide, EVs account for 13% of new car sales, up from 0.2% a decade ago. Their market share in the U.S. has nearly doubled over the last year, to 5.8%, thanks in part to federal tax credits of $7,500 included in the Inflation Reduction Act. Biden's new regulations aim to accelerate the transition, by lowering the cap on carbon emissions for new vehicles by 56% between 2026 and 2032. For automakers to meet the tougher standards, 67% of their sales would have to come from zero-emission EVs. The administration projects that this would reduce the U.S.'s carbon footprint by 7.3 billion tons by 2055, the equivalent of eliminating four years' worth of transportation-related emissions. Such goals are laudable, but as things stand it's doubtful that the U.S. can achieve them. Generous subsidies have juiced demand for EVs, but maintaining them will be costly. The average price of a new EV is still $12,000 higher than that of a gas guzzler. Experts project that it may reach parity as early as this year, but even then, Americans are unlikely to abandon their gas-powered cars if the battery-charging infrastructure remains inadequate. Note too that EV buyers don't typically stop driving their other cars: Current EV owners have an average of 2.7 vehicles, compared to 2.1 among all households, and two-thirds use their gas-powered vehicles more often. Other factors will also complicate the transition. The auto industry's rapid shift to EVs at the expense of new and more efficient gas-powered models might cause some consumers to keep driving dirtier vehicles longer than they otherwise would. Electric vehicles also create carbon footprints of their own, once one accounts for the mineral extraction needed to assemble their batteries and the electricity needed to power them. That's to say nothing of the supply-chain challenges: At the moment, the production of numerous vital components is largely controlled by China. EV uptake should certainly be encouraged — but alongside measures to mitigate these challenges and guard against unintended consequences. Policymakers need to speed the buildout of charging stations and promote domestic extraction of critical minerals. No less important, cheaper fuel-efficient alternatives and rival zero-emission technologies should be allowed to compete with EVs on level terms. Ideally, an economywide tax on carbon emissions should be part of the mix. This would raise the price of gasoline and encourage consumers to buy clean-energy cars (regardless of the technology used) while driving their older, dirtier models less. Crucially, it would also promote energy efficiency more broadly and accelerate efforts to decarbonize the supply of electricity. Granted, building political support in the U.S. for a carbon tax is challenging. Until that changes, the government can still incentivize low-carbon transportation more effectively — by extending tax credits to gas-powered hybrids and imposing congestion charges on high-polluting cars in urban areas, for example. Fighting climate change requires a comprehensive and coherent strategy. EVs are part of the answer, but only part. Much hard work remains to be done.",minneapolis-star-tribune,central,arresting climate change requires among thing widespread adoption electric vehicle managing transition gaspowered car will not easy president joe bidens administration proposed new rule sharply limit tailpipe emission aim compelling automaker devote least twothirds new sale ev within next decade policy work government get lot thing right logic behind plan straightforward eliminate carbon emission 2050 yous need slash pollution car truck getting electric vehicle road help without supporting policy ev unlikely cut carbon emission much advocate envision policymakers owe public honest accounting cost benefit worldwide ev account 13 new car sale 02 decade ago market share yous nearly doubled last year 58 thanks part federal tax credit 7500 included inflation reduction act bidens new regulation aim accelerate transition lowering cap carbon emission new vehicle 56 2026 2032 automaker meet tougher standard 67 sale would come zeroemission ev administration project would reduce youss carbon footprint 73 billion ton 2055 equivalent eliminating four year worth transportationrelated emission goal laudable thing stand doubtful yous achieve generous subsidy juiced demand ev maintaining costly average price new ev still 12000 higher gas guzzler experts project may reach parity early year even americans unlikely abandon gaspowered car batterycharging infrastructure remains inadequate note ev buyer do not typically stop driving car current ev owner average 27 vehicle compared 21 among household twothirds use gaspowered vehicle often factor also complicate transition auto industry rapid shift ev expense new efficient gaspowered model might because consumer keep driving dirtier vehicle longer otherwise would electric vehicle also create carbon footprint one account mineral extraction needed assemble battery electricity needed power that is say nothing supplychain challenge moment production numerous vital component largely controlled china ev uptake certainly encouraged alongside measure mitigate challenge guard unintended consequence policymakers need speed buildout charging station promote domestic extraction critical mineral le important cheaper fuelefficient alternative rival zeroemission technology allowed compete ev level term ideally economywide tax carbon emission part mix would raise price gasoline encourage consumer buy cleanenergy car regardless technology used driving older dirtier model le crucially would also promote energy efficiency broadly accelerate effort decarbonize supply electricity granted building political support yous carbon tax challenging change government still incentivize lowcarbon transportation effectively extending tax credit gaspowered hybrid imposing congestion charge highpolluting car urban area example fighting climate change requires comprehensive coherent strategy ev part answer part much hard work remains done ,05-21-2023
5,"Energy secretary announces electric vehicle grants, spotlights clean energy in Minnesota","Two Minnesota organizations, including a Native-led nonprofit, have been awarded $1.67 million each in federal dollars to make electric vehicles (EVs) more accessible to underserved communities. U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm announced the grants on her swing through the Twin Cities on Friday, spotlighting President Joe Biden's administration's Investing in America agenda. Transportation is the country's biggest polluter, Granholm said, adding that she's ""impatient"" to reach the administration's goal of 500,000 EV charging stations across the country by 2030. ""We want all, all Americans to have access to clean transportation,"" Granholm said in remarks at the St. Paul offices of the American Lung Association. Fossil-fuel-based transportation is a major source of the heat-trapping greenhouse gases driving the climate crisis. The burden of other pollutants in the exhaust, such as fine particulate matter, is heavier for nonwhite and low-income communities in the United States, according to the American Lung Association. The association, a grant recipient, will direct the money to various partners includingEV Spot NetworkandEvie Carshare, entities owned by the city of St. Paul that have deployed car-sharing EVs and charging stations in low-income areas across Minneapolis and St. Paul. The grant will fund 10 additional EV charging hubs containing 40 Level 2 charging ports on St. Paul's diverse East Side, including along the Gold Line bus rapid transit route. Neighborhood leaders will help determine the best locations for all the chargers. St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, on hand for the event, praised the effort. He said the popular car-share program ""felt like a moonshot"" when they first started talking about it a few years ago. It has grown to 2,500 trips a week, he said.Leila Navidi, Star TribuneU.S. Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, center, posed for a photo with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, left, and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter during a visit to the American Lung Association of Minnesota to announce money for local EV projects on Friday, May 19, 2023 in St. Paul, Minn. ] LEILA NAVIDI • leila.navidi@startribune.com Likewise, the grant to Native Sun Community Power Development, a Minneapolis-based Native-led nonprofit, will allow it to expand into Wisconsin and Michigan and install at least 15 new charging stations in tribal communities, including DC fast-chargers. The new grant follows $6.67 million the Energy Department awarded Native Sun in 2021 for an Upper Midwest Inter-Tribal EV Charging Community Network to serve various tribal communities, including the Red Lake Band of Chippewa in Minnesota and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in the Dakotas. During an interview, Native Sun executive director Robert Blake said the price of used Nissan Leaf EVs has come down and become affordable. This is a situation where ""if you build it they will come,"" Blake said. ""We are going to lead this transition,"" Blake said. Earlier Friday, Granholm joined Gov. Tim Walz and other leaders in a ribbon-cutting at the Cummins manufacturing campus in Fridley. The plant has started producing large hydrogen electrolyzers for the hydrogen fuel cells that power steel makers, utilities and vehicles. It's the company's first U.S. electrolyzer production facility;  Bidenvisited itin April. The equipment uses electricity to generate hydrogen by splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen. The hydrogen gas is stored for use in hydrogen fuel cells to make electricity for a range of uses. Granholm told the group gathered at Cummins — business leaders, employees, officials, lawmakers and media — that the Energy Department has been working on the technology for decades. The agency is trying to make it more competitive by bringing down the cost of clean hydrogen 80% in a decade, to $1 per kilogram. ""We believe at the Department of Energy that clean hydrogen is the Swiss army knife of zero-carbon technologies,"" Granholm said. Cummins spokesman Jon Mills said his company hasn't received federal money for the Fridley electrolyzer production, but that the 2022 federal Inflation Reduction Act has incentives to drive the purchase of U.S.-based green hydrogen. The act ""was a reason we did this,"" Mills said. Out on the production floor, manufacturing leader Shaun Crudup said he's worked at Cummins for years and is excited about the change.

6,This farm reporter roams rural Minnesota by EV — and it's no easy task,"The first time I knew our new Nissan Leaf was a dud came when I was stranded — with a nearly drained battery — in a St. Cloud parking lot, calling in on Zoom as a panelist at a turkey convention that I couldn't reach in time. These are the kinds of gigs you get invited to as an agriculture journalist in Minnesota — and meeting farmers face-to-face is a crucial part of my job in understanding the communities I cover. So I'd left our home in Minneapolis bright and early to reach Alexandria, where I had planned to join the panel. Driving our electric vehicle (EV) around Minnesota as a farm reporter over the prior two months had proven, well, adventurous. Our state does not yet have widespread adoption of electric charging infrastructure — and I've got the battle stories to prove it. America says it wants more electric vehicles. And for good reason: Gas-guzzling is an addiction that is overheating our planet. This summer, the Biden administration rankled car dealers when it called for 75% new vehicles by 2032 to not carry any internal-combustion engines. Now, after owning an EV more than six months — and using that vehicle for work as a journalist that involves predominantly driving across rural America — my personal experience suggests we're unprepared to help consumers successfully transition. One question that emerges: Will EV become the Ford Pinto, a once-hyped car that soon fell out of favor? EVs are a key part of our nation's energy transition, but the wide-open spaces of rural Minnesota present huge infrastructure hurdles. The Public Utilities Commission and outstate entities, such as Otter Tail Power, have acknowledged this to be true. But the current pace of building out stations is dampening the success. The chargers are too far apart, too few and not universally well-maintained. ZEF Energy, which runs a number of chargers in greater Minnesota, didn't return my phone call. Neither did the mayor of Sioux Falls, who rejected federal funds that would've helped build-out the city's charging infrastructure (the city currently boasts no fast-chargers for our Leaf). There is progress in pockets. Leech Lake  Band of Ojibwe's Brandy Toft, the band's environmental director, says it is building out more chargers on the reservation, which already has a fast-charger available at Northern Lights casino. ""The primary focus wasn't, 'Oh come spend your money,'"" Toft said. ""It's because I have a girlfriend who has a Leaf. She has small children. She's a single woman. The casino is brightly lit. It always has cameras. There are people there. There's food, shelter, whatever."" Still, for a lot of swaths of our state, parents may be concerned about buying a vehicle that could leave them stranded in a blizzard, trying to get their kid home from a hockey game or envisioning a late-night call for a tow truck after running out of juice after a piano recital. My close calls weren't for lack of effort. I can recite the towns with our particular breed of fast-charger: Cannon Falls, Princeton, Hudson, Wis. I've penciled out distances. Sixty miles to the charger behind the cute coffee shop in St. Peter? Can I reach the charger at Winona State or will I need to hop the Amtrak to get back home? And yet here I was on that day in St. Cloud, just 60 miles from home. I'd triple-checked my app before the morning's two-hour drive to Alexandria (our car's range clocks in at roughly 175 miles). But my battery's percentage had dropped faster than a curling stone into a lake. When I reached the fast-chargers — in Monticello and St. Cloud — one was blocked by an overnight parked car and the other didn't turn on. I was stuck. Soon, that sweaty-palmed reality gave way to plain-old embarrassment. I'd need to let the convention's organizers know I couldn't make it. Fortunately, the turkey association's president, Ashley Kohls, phoned me and asked if I could call in remotely. But I felt, nevertheless, like the real turkey. And I wish I could report my story was an anomaly as our country starts the transition to clean, emissions-free technology. But, at least for a lot of rural Americans, the EV future still feels fanciful. I remember arriving at a Land O'Lakes farm in Cannon Falls, rolling in on fumes, sucking in my gut and saying a silent prayer. I've chatted up a Ford F-150 Lightning driver from Brainerd in the Detroit Lakes liquor store parking lot about our common enemy: range anxiety. It's that same feeling as when you're about to run out of gas, but without a red pail of fuel that can bail you out. I've also heard the counterarguments. ""My son-in-law drove the Eastern Seaboard in an EV and never had to sweat it."" ""We went leaf-peeping on the North Shore in our Tesla, and the only stress we had was whether to get blueberry or coconut cream at Betty's Pies."" I don't doubt these tales. But what's conveniently missing from all of these highway adventures: Commutes. Deliveries. Children. Winter. I've yet to own our car in winter, when its efficiency drops, and already my wife prudently demands we use my parents' SUV when we travel out of town with our 16-month-old baby. We asked our friends, also owners of an EV, what they do when they travel north to a cabin in Ely. Their response: ""We just rent a car."" For now, I press on in my Leaf. On a recent evening, I headed north from Minneapolis, hoping to catch a sugar beet harvest the next morning. I needed a charge in Little Falls and pulled into a small park along the Mississippi River. When I opened my door, I was greeted by the dulcet sounds of a small brass ensemble coming from the picnic shelter.

7,Minnesota auto dealers lose court fight with state pollution regulators over 'clean car' rule,"The Minnesota Court of Appeals has upheld the state's ""clean car"" rulemaking, backing the authority of the state's pollution regulator to try to get more zero-emission vehicles onto sales lots in the fight against climate change. The decision, released Monday, is a loss for the Minnesota Automobile Dealers Association, which has been challenging the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) over the rulemaking. The industry group has characterized it as unnecessary regulatory overreach. Doug Seaton, who heads the Upper Midwest Law Center in Minneapolis and works with the auto dealers group, said they were disappointed and will likely petition the state Supreme Court to hear the case. ""We think it's the wrong decision,"" Seaton said. ""We knew from the outset this would potentially take going to the Supreme Court."" Minnesotans for Clean Cars, a coalition of environmental groups, issued a news release applauding the decision as a win. Transportation has been the state's biggest source of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, particularly with regard to passenger vehicles. Joy Anderson, supervising attorney for the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, said in the release that Minnesotans want more opportunities to buy electric vehicles, which automakers have been sending to other states with strict emissions standards.

8,2023 tax credits may boost the appeal of electric vehicles,"businessAutos ByThe Associated Press 5:38 AM on Dec 28, 2022 CST WASHINGTON — Starting Jan. 1, many Americans will qualify for a tax credit of up to $7,500 for buying an electric vehicle. The credit, part of changes enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act, is designed to spur EV sales and reduce greenhouse emissions. But a complex web of requirements, including where vehicles and batteries must be manufactured to qualify, is casting doubt on whether anyone can receive the full $7,500 credit next year. For at least the first two months of 2023, though, a delay in the Treasury Department’s rules for the new benefit will likely make the full credit temporarily available to consumers who meet certain income and price limits. The new law also provides a smaller credit for people who buy a used EV. Become a business insider with the latest news. By signing up you agree to ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy Policy Certain EV brands that were eligible for a separate tax credit that began in 2010 and that will end this year may not be eligible for the new credit. Several EV models made by Kia, Hyundai and Audi, for example, won’t qualify at all because they are manufactured outside North America. The new tax credit, which lasts until 2032, is intended to make zero-emission vehicles affordable to more people. Here is a closer look at it: The credit of up to $7,500 will be offered to people who buy certain new electric vehicles as well as some plug-in gas-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. For people who buy a used vehicle that runs on battery power, a $4,000 credit will be available. But the question of which vehicles and buyers will qualify for the credits is complicated and will remain uncertain until Treasury issues the proposed rules in March. What’s known so far is that to qualify for the credit, new EVs must be made in North America. In addition, there are caps on vehicle prices and buyer incomes that are intended to disqualify wealthier buyers. Starting in March, complex provisions will also govern battery components. Forty percent of battery minerals will have to come from North America or a country with a U.S. free trade agreement or be recycled in North America. (That threshold will eventually go to 80%.) And 50% of the battery parts will have to be made or assembled in North America, eventually rising to 100%. Starting in 2025, battery minerals cannot come from a “foreign entity of concern,” mainly China and Russia. Battery parts cannot be sourced in those countries starting in 2024 — a troublesome obstacle for the auto industry because numerous EV metals and parts now come from China. There are also battery-size requirements. Because of the many remaining uncertainties, it’s not entirely clear which vehicles are eligible. General Motors and Tesla have the most EVs assembled in North America. Each also makes batteries in the U.S. But because of the requirements for where batteries, minerals and parts must be manufactured, it’s likely that buyers of those vehicles would initially receive only half the tax credit, or $3,750. GM says its eligible EVs should qualify for the $3,750 credit by March, with the full credit available in 2025. Until Treasury issues its rules, though, the requirements governing where minerals and parts must be sourced will be waived. This will allow eligible buyers to receive the full $7,500 tax incentive for qualifying models early in 2023. The Energy Department says 29 EV and plug-in models were manufactured in North America in the 2022 and 2023 model years. They’re from Audi, BMW, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Ford, GMC, Jeep, Lincoln, Lucid, Nissan, Rivian, Tesla, Volvo, Cadillac, Mercedes and Volkswagen. Yet because of price limits or battery-size requirements, not all these vehicle models will qualify for credits. To qualify, new electric sedans cannot have a sticker price above $55,000. Pickup trucks, SUVs and vans can’t be over $80,000. This will disqualify two higher-priced Tesla models. Though Tesla’s top sellers, the models 3 and Y, will be eligible, with options, those vehicles might exceed the price limits. Kelley Blue Book says the average EV now costs over $65,000, though lower-priced models are coming. For new EVs, buyers cannot have an adjusted gross income above $150,000 if single, $300,000 if filing jointly and $225,000 if they’re head of a household. For used EVs, buyers cannot earn more than $75,000 if single, $150,000 if filing jointly and $112,500 if head of household. At first, it will be applied to your 2023 tax return, which you file in 2024. Starting in 2024, consumers can transfer the credit to a dealership to lower the vehicle price at purchase. Yes, but it will probably take a few years, said Mike Fiske, associate director for S&P Global Mobility. The credit may cause a bump in sales early next year because of Treasury’s delay in issuing the stricter requirements. But most automakers are now selling all the EVs they build and cannot make more because of shortages of parts, including computer chips. And automakers may have trouble certifying the sources of battery minerals and parts, a requirement for buyers to receive the full credit. Automakers have been scrambling to move more EV supply chains to the U.S. Consumers can receive tax credits of up to $4,000 — or 30% of the vehicle price, whichever is less — for buying EVs that are at least two years old. But the used EV must cost less than $25,000 — a tall order given the starting prices for most EVs on the market. A search onAutotrader.comshows that the Chevy Bolt, the Nissan Leaf and other relatively economical used EVs are listed at $26,000 or more for models dating back to 2019. On the other hand, used EVs don’t have to be made in North America or comply with the battery-sourcing requirements. That means that, for instance, a 2022 Kia EV6 that’s ineligible for the new-vehicle credit because it’s made in South Korea can qualify for a used-car credit if its price falls below $25,000. “The real effects where these tax credits will have a big impact will be in the 2026 to 2032 period — a few years into the future — as automakers gear up and volumes increase,” said Chris Harto, a senior policy analyst forConsumer Reports. The credits are part of roughly $370 billion in spending on clean energy — America’s largest investment to fight climate change — that was signed into law in August by President Joe Biden. EVs make up about 5% of U.S. new-vehicle sales; Biden has set a goal of 50% by 2030. Sales of EVs have been climbing, particularly as California and other states have moved to phase out gas-powered cars. The rise of lower-cost competitors to Tesla, such as the Chevy Equinox, with an expected base price of around $30,000, are expected to broaden the EVs’ reach to middle-class households. S&P Global Mobility expects EVs’ share of auto sales to reach 8% next year, 15% by 2025 and 37% by 2030. That’s not clear yet. Some U.S. allies are upset over North American manufacturing requirements that disqualify EVs made in Europe or South Korea. The requirements knock Hyundai and Kia out of the credits, at least in the short term. They plan to build new EV and battery plants in Georgia, but those won’t open until 2025. European Union countries fear that the tax credits could make their automakers move factories to the U.S. The Treasury Department said it would release information by year’s end on the “anticipated direction” of the battery sourcing and mineral requirements. A loosening of rules to address U.S. allies’ concerns would make more EVs eligible. But it also risks extending U.S. reliance on foreign supply chains. If you install an EV charger at home, credits may be available. The new law revives a federal tax credit that had expired in 2021; it provides 30% of the cost of hardware and installation, up to $1,000. It adds a requirement that the charger must be in a low-income or non-urban area. Businesses that install new EV chargers in those areas can receive tax credits of as much as 30% — up to $100,000 per charger. Residential EV chargers can range in cost from $200 to $1,000; installation can add several more hundred dollars. That’s entirely a personal decision. If you’ve grown tired of volatile gasoline prices and are considering an EV, you might want to go ahead. Buying a qualifying EV in January or February could net you the full $7,500 tax break before more stringent requirements take effect in March. Additional state credits also may be available. But if you’re still on the fence, there’s no urgency. Consumers who rush to buy now, when relatively few qualifying EVs are available, may face dealer price markups. Within a few years, technology will improve, and more EVs will qualify for full credits.

9,Are electric vehicles the future? Here’s what State Fair of Texas visitors are saying,"News ByNoor Adatia 8:00 AM on Oct 8, 2022 CDT Among its usual lineup of cars, trucks and SUVs, this year’s auto show at the State Fair of Texas features nearly a dozen electric vehicles, and fairgoers have been eager to check out the vehicles that could replace their gas-powered cars down the road. With more federal dollars going toward EV infrastructure, interest in electric vehicles has gained traction among consumers who drive gas-powered cars — and more options are becoming available to buyers. Over the next five years, Texas plans to build more than 50 charging stations across the state’s highways,using part of the $408 million in federal money approved last week. And the recent passage of the federalInflation Reduction Actprovides many buyers with tax incentives of up to $7,500 for newly purchased EVs whose component parts are manufactured and assembled in the U.S. The bill also lifts a cap of 200,000 vehicles that can receive tax credits, providing incentive for automakers to produce more cars. Get the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond. By signing up you agree to ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy Policy With the promise of more infrastructure and investments down the road, some fairgoers at the auto show expressed interest in buying an electric vehicle in the future. Garland resident Cory Woodward said Friday he has been looking at EVs for their advanced technology. “Electric is going to be the future; maybe not necessarily so fast, but it will be, so I think they’re cool,” said Woodward, who has ordered a 2022 Ford Mustang Mach E but is on the fence about going through with the purchase. “I think they’re overpriced right now as is, but we’re probably two to three years before most of them become reasonable,” he said. Woodward added that there are some reasonably priced electric vehicles on the market but the Mustang Mach E — which starts around $44,000 — isn’t one of them. “There are some reasonable ones out there, but this one is not.” Auto show visitor Azumi Park agreed that EVs tend to be pricey but expects that will change as cars with gasoline engines are phased out. “I think it’s maybe going to go down when they make a transition eventually, so that’s when I’m trying to buy one probably,” she said. Fairgoer Nick Hansen said he’s in the market for an electric vehicle primarily because they require less maintenance than gas vehicles — but he doesn’t think the prices make financial sense. “Right now it’s just not economical with the pricing; you’re better off buying a gas car and paying for gas,” he said.

10,"Only 10 electric vehicles will qualify for $7,500 tax credit","businessAutos ByThe Associated Press 1:38 PM on Apr 17, 2023 CDT Ten electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles will be eligible for a $7,500 U.S. tax credit, while another seven could get $3,750 under new federal rules that go into effect on Tuesday. But under the Treasury Department rules and other provisions of last year’s Inflation Reduction Act, most of the more than 60 electric or plug-in hybrids on sale in the U.S. won’t get any tax credits. That could slow acceptance of electric vehicles and could delay reaching President Joe Biden’s ambitious goal that half of new passenger vehicles sold in the U.S. run on electricity by 2030. The new rules, which govern how much battery minerals and parts can come from countries that don’t have free trade agreements with the U.S., bumped nine vehicles off the tax credit eligibility list that went into effect Jan. 1. Become a business insider with the latest news. By signing up you agree to ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy Policy The 10 vehicles eligible for the full $7,500 credit are: The seven models that could get a $3,750 credit include the Jeep Wrangler and Grand Cherokee plug-ins, Ford’s Mustang Mach-E SUV, Escape plug-in and E-Transit electric van, the Lincoln Corsair Grand Touring plug-in and the standard range rear-wheel-drive version of Tesla’s Model 3. Consumers can check to see if the EV they’re considering is eligible for a credit atwww.fueleconomy.gov. To be eligible, electric vehicles or plug-ins have to be manufactured in North America. SUVs, vans and trucks can’t have a sticker price greater than $80,000, while cars can’t sticker for more than $55,000. There also are income limits for buyers. The Treasury Department says the new list shows that families who want to buy an electric or plug-in vehicle “will continue to have a number of options to receive a full or partial tax credit in the near term” under rules designed to build electric vehicle production and a supply chain in the U.S. The reduction in eligible EVs also could conflict with the administration’s proposed strict new automobile pollution limits announced last week. The new standards would require up to two-thirds of new vehicles sold in the U.S. to be electric by 2032. That’s a nearly tenfold increase over current electric vehicle sales. Many of the vehicles that aren’t eligible for the credit are made outside of North America, but their manufacturers are building assembly and battery plants in the U.S., and more vehicles will become eligible. Some auto industry analysts say that while $7,500 would be enough to entice people away from internal combustion vehicles, a $3,750 tax credit might not be enough to offset the average U.S. new EV price. Kelley Blue Book says the average U.S. new EV costs about $58,600, nearly $10,000 more than the average new vehicle price. To be sure, average EV prices are falling as more people buy less-expensive models. The average EV price was $63,500 a year ago. Jeff Schuster, executive vice president of LMC Automotive and Global Data, said half of the full tax credit isn’t enough. “You’re shrinking the market essentially by the vehicles not being affordable,” he said, adding that the average combustion engine vehicle isn’t affordable either. The big issue in the rules that are effective Tuesday are limits on the percentage of battery parts and minerals that come from countries that don’t have free trade or mineral agreements with the United States. This year, at least 40% of the value of battery minerals must be mined, processed or recycled in the U.S. or countries with which it has trade deals. That rises 10% every year until it hits 80% after 2026. Also, at least 50% of the value of battery parts must be manufactured or assembled in North America this year. That requirement rises to 60% next year and in 2025 and jumps 10% each year until it hits 100% after 2028. In addition to the price limits, there also are income limits aimed to stop wealthier people from getting credits. Buyers cannot have an adjusted gross annual income above $150,000 if single, $300,000 if filing jointly and $225,000 if head of a household. In addition, starting in 2025, battery minerals cannot come from a “foreign entity of concern,” mainly China and Russia. Battery parts cannot be sourced in those countries starting in 2024; minerals can’t come from those countries in 2025. The Biden administration said rules governing that requirement are in the works. Even though the rules are effective Tuesday, the Biden administration is taking public comments, and they can be modified later, including the addition of countries that negotiate trade agreements with the U.S. Tom Krisher, Associated Press The Associated Press",dallasnews,central,businessautos bythe associated press 138 pm apr 17 2023 cdt ten electric plugin hybrid vehicle eligible 7500 yous tax credit another seven could get 3750 new federal rule go effect tuesday treasury department rule provision last year inflation reduction act 60 electric plugin hybrid sale yous will not get tax credit could slow acceptance electric vehicle could delay reaching president joe bidens ambitious goal half new passenger vehicle sold yous run electricity 2030 new rule govern much battery mineral part come country do not free trade agreement yous bumped nine vehicle tax credit eligibility list went effect january 1 become business insider latest news signing agree ourterms serviceandprivacy policy 10 vehicle eligible full 7500 credit seven model could get 3750 credit include jeep wrangler grand cherokee plugins fords mustang mache suv escape plugin etransit electric van lincoln corsair grand touring plugin standard range rearwheeldrive version teslas model 3 consumers check see ev they are considering eligible credit at eligible electric vehicle plugins manufactured north america suvs van truck cannot sticker price greater 80000 car cannot sticker 55000 also income limit buyer treasury department say new list show family want buy electric plugin vehicle continue number option receive full partial tax credit near term rule designed build electric vehicle production supply chain yous reduction eligible ev also could conflict administration proposed strict new automobile pollution limit announced last week new standard would require twothirds new vehicle sold yous electric 2032 that is nearly tenfold increase current electric vehicle sale many vehicle are not eligible credit made outside north america manufacturer building assembly battery plant yous vehicle become eligible auto industry analyst say 7500 would enough entice people away internal combustion vehicle 3750 tax credit might enough offset average yous new ev price kelley blue book say average yous new ev cost 58600 nearly 10000 average new vehicle price sure average ev price falling people buy lessexpensive model average ev price 63500 year ago jeff schuster executive vice president lmc automotive global data half full tax credit is not enough you are shrinking market essentially vehicle affordable adding average combustion engine vehicle is not affordable either big issue rule effective tuesday limit percentage battery part mineral come country do not free trade mineral agreement united states year least 40 value battery mineral must mined processed recycled yous country trade deal rise 10 every year hit 80 2026 also least 50 value battery part must manufactured assembled north america year requirement rise 60 next year 2025 jump 10 year hit 100 2028 addition price limit also income limit aimed stop wealthier people getting credit buyers adjusted gross annual income 150000 single 300000 filing jointly 225000 head household addition starting 2025 battery mineral come foreign entity concern mainly china russia battery part sourced country starting 2024 mineral cannot come country 2025 biden administration rule governing requirement work even though rule effective tuesday biden administration taking public comment modified later including addition country negotiate trade agreement yous tom krisher associated press associated press,04-17-2023
11,New Texas laws aimed at sharp rise in electric vehicle ownership in Lone Star State,"newsPolitics ByAarón Torres 6:00 AM on Jul 3, 2023 CDT AUSTIN — Texans are known for their long road trips, and gas stations dot the state’s highways to keep them driving, but drivers in electric vehicles may experience something else: “range anxiety.” Texas lags other states in adopting EVs, and lacks essential charging stations needed to keep the electric engines powered. But as Tesla, Ford and Rivian increase mass production of electric vehicles, lawmakers are trying to lay the groundwork for easier adoption. In the Legislature’s regular session that ended May 29, EV advocates successfully nudged several bills to passage — not all they wanted, but enough, they say, to keep momentum going for an essential ingredient: more charging stations. “When you look at reasons people don’t buy electric vehicles, No. 1 is cost, and that’s changing rapidly” and decreasing, said Tom “Smitty” Smith, executive director of the Texas Electric Transportation Resources Alliance, and an electric vehicle owner. “The No. 2 [reason] is charging access or range anxiety.” Get the latest politics news from North Texas and beyond.

There are more than 12,000 devices — or pumps — in the Lone Star State from which one can fuel up a gas-powered car. Meanwhile, there are only about 2,900 charging stations in Texas. There are about 18.7 charging stations per 100,000 residents, putting Texas 36th among states, according todata by the software company CoPilot.Vermont and California rank No. 1 and 2, respectively, and the top 10 states have at least 55 charging stations per 100,000 residents. But new laws signed by Gov. Greg Abbott will help fast-track development of more charging stations as electric vehicle ownership increases. One law — Senate Bill 1001 — also increases transparency by displaying the cost to use a charger before charging and creates a process for the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation to inspect the chargers — similar to how it inspects gas stations. Another — Senate Bill 1002 — ensures that utility companies can’t undercut private retailers and other businesses that offer charging stations by offering charging at a lower rate. Advocates say the measure is vital to building out a network of charging stations. The presence of more charges is particularly important to electric vehicle owners who are unable to charge their vehicles at home. Neal Farris, an electric vehicle owner in Dallas and vice president of the North Texas Electric Vehicle Auto Association, owns an electric BMW i3. He charges at home and said he has rarely used a public charger. He believes charging stations will be less important as more gas stations offer chargers. “Those destination charge stations are going to become irrelevant over time,” Farris said. But that future is likely to be decades away. There are more than 202,800 electric vehicles registered in Texas, according to Texas Department of Transportation data compiled by the Dallas Fort Worth-Clean Cities Coalition. As of 2021, there were more than 20 million gasoline-powered vehicles registered in the state,according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The federal government under President Joe Biden has hoped to incentivize purchasing electric vehicles, which are seen as a cleaner fuel source that will cut down on emissions. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 gave Texas $400 million in federal funds. The state has said it plans to use that money to build more than 50 new charging stations along state highways. TxDOT aims to have a charging station every 50 to 70 miles, according toa plan released in 2022,and will award contracts  to build those stations. No contracts have been awarded yet, a department spokesman said. The plan does not set a time frame for completing the stations. Some say the shift to electric vehicles raises equity questions. Research has shown that the average owner of an electric vehicle tends to be white and college-educated, living in a single-family home. The average price of a new electric vehicle in May was $55,488,according to Kelly Blue Book. Car companies hope to help bridge the gap in electric vehicle ownership among demographic groups. General Motors has announced plan to make electric vehicles for everyone. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Austin-based Tesla, has repeatedly touted the idea ofproducing a Tesla that sells for $25,000. “I think they’re going to take a more practical profile here pretty quickly,” said state Sen. Nathan Johnson, D-Dallas. “If we’re going to see an electric vehicle adoption on a large scale beyond the novelty and luxury level that it presently occupies, we are going to need serious build-out of that infrastructure here.” Aarón Torres, Austin Bureau Correspondent.

12,How electric vehicles can help cities like Houston fight climate change,"Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner was one ofmore than 300 mayorswho departed from President Donald Trump's decision to exit the Paris climate agreement. And this departure reaffirmed what was already clear: The federal government is no longer leading American efforts to shrink our carbon footprint. In fact, Houston is just one of many local and state governments –along with businessesand consumers– aiming to help fill this policy void. At least a dozen governors have joined theUnited States Climate Alliance, committing their states to achieve emissions reductions consistent with President Barack Obama’s Paris pledge. My researchwith my former studentShayak Senguptaabout how cities like Houston can benefit from buying electric cars suggests that fuel-free municipal fleets can cut urban carbon footprints while improvingpublic healthand saving taxpayers money. Here's a map of the 12 states, 1 territory and 211 cities committed to the Paris Agreement targets (as of 5pm EDT). 125 million people.pic.twitter.com/YfRexyWvbi  Options for states and cities States can help curb emissions in many ways, such as bysetting capson power plant emissions andcreating incentives and targetsfor renewable electricity. Most of those steps lies beyond the jurisdiction of cities. So how can they take climate action? Urban governments most strongly impact emissions byinfluencing the behaviorof local residents and businesses through building codes and incentives, public transit and urban planning. Buyingincreasingly affordableelectric vehicles gives cities an additional opportunity to cutclimate-warming emissionsby reducing the amount of fossil fuels their vehicles consume. Historically, cities and transit agencies turned tonatural gasas an alternative fuel for fleet vehicles and buses. However, ourprevious researchshowed that natural gas does not provide significant emissions savings compared with gasoline cars or diesel buses. Electric vehicles, however, can bring about clear-cut reductions in carbon emissions.  The electric vehicle market U.S. cities own few of the540,000 electric carson the road nationwide as of 2016. The nation’s two largest cities,New York CityandLos Angeles, operate 1,000 and 200 electric cars, respectively. That could soon change. Thirty cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston,are seeking bulk-rate dealson electric vehicles. They’ve asked manufacturers to submit bids to supply up to 114,000 electric vehicles, ranging from police cruisers to trash haulers, at a totalcost of roughly $10 billion. This surge in electric vehicle sales could make them more affordable — not just for cities but for the rest of us, too. That’s because emerging technologies typically get cheaper as production increases. A study by researchers from theStockholm Environment Instituteestimates that electric car batteries prices fall by 6 percent to 9 percentevery time production doubles. Someanalystsforecastthat as soon as 2025, electric cars will become cheaper than gasoline-powered cars. In some cases, they are already cheaper to own and operate over the vehicle’s lifetime,our researchhas shown. If cities help ramp up demand for electric cars faster than anticipated, this transition could happen even faster.  Municipal fleets City-owned fleets are in some ways ideal candidates for electric-powered transportation. Cities operate large numbers of vehicles in densely populated areas, where emissions most endangerhuman health. Local driving by municipal employees is well-suited for electric cars. For example, the Nissan Leaf now has a range of as much as107 miles, and the Chevy Bolt can travel238 mileswithout recharging. Meanwhile, electric models of pickup trucks, dump trucks, buses and police cruisers are becomingincreasingly available.  Houston's vehicles We studiedvehicle options available  to Houston, whichoperates a fleetof about 12,000 vehicles, in 2015. Those options included two gasoline-powered Toyota sedans (the Corolla and the Prius), the natural gas-powered Honda Civic, the plug-in hybrid Toyota Prius and the fully electric Nissan Leaf. Since all these sedans seat five passengers, they are interchangeable. Because Houston in 2015 bought 75 percent of its electricity from wind farms (it now drawseven more of its power from wind and solarsources),we calculatedthat the fully electric Leaf would have reduced life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 87 percent relative to the gasoline-powered Corolla over seven years. About half of those benefits would have been lost if the Leaf was charged from the fossil-heavy gridelsewhere in Texas. Financially, the savings on fuel and maintenance would have more than offset the $12,000 premium for buying a Leaf instead of a Corolla. We estimated that Houston would have saved about $.0.04 per mile while operating the Leafs, as long as enough charging stations were available. That’s even before counting any savings from bulk purchases orfederal tax credits. Now that the City has negotiated itsnew solar deal, it'sleading all cities in renewable power purchasesand getting 89 percent of its power from renewables. So, electric vehicles today would cut emissions even more than at the time of our study.  Charging stations One significant problem holding back demand for electric vehicles is the shortage of charging stations. Greater availability of charging stations assures cities and consumers that full electrics like the Nissan Leaf can complete their trips, and lets plug-in hybrids like the Chevy Volt operate mostly in electric mode. That’s whycities like Pittsburghhave obtained state grants to build their own, whileutilities in SeattleandKansas Cityare building charging stations to jump-start demand for electric cars. Electric municipal fleets won’t by themselves propel cities all the way to their Paris-based pledges. But by speeding the adoption of charging stations and cleaner cars, they could help curb emissions – while saving money for urban taxpayers and improving public health.

13,Opinion: Electric vehicles are no silver bullet,"Regarding ""Tomlinson: GM’s new Hummer and other EVs pose challenge to Elon Musk and Texas's oil industry,"" (Jan. 16): Tomlinson breezily dismisses any stress on the Texas grid that an increase in EVs would create by stating that people would charge their cars at night. However, this is precisely when energy derived from both wind and solar can be at their lowest. Clearly, solar energy is at a minimum when the sun goes down but so can wind. Wind speed over landtends to decrease during the nightwhen the ground is not heated by the sun. Grid storage batteries deplete in two to four hours depending on power usage and the cost can be prohibitive. One popular grid storage battery, the Tesla Megapack, costs$691,369.23 per megawatt hour. Furthermore, Gillingham and others at Yale document that, using today’s prices for coal and hydrocarbons, widespread adoption of electric carsmay actually increase CO2 emissions. They note that for EVs to have a positive effect on CO2 emissions, it would require large increases in the cost of fossil fuel energy in the form of carbon taxes. This wouldlikely greatly affect the nation’s poorand make our products far less competitive in global markets. That would work to the great benefit of China, where51.7 percentof the world's coal is burned and where they are currently building33 gigawatts of coal-based power generation, three times more than the rest of the world combined. Jory A. Pacht, Houston Here he goes again. Chris Tomlinson's column once again extols the virtues of EVs, and how they will replace the internal combustion engine. Maybe I did not read clearly enough, however I did not read where he states how long it takes to charge an electric vehicle. Other reading in the Wall Street Journal tells meit takes 20 minutes or more to recharge, on average, with a high-powered DC fast charger. Imagine waiting 30 minutes to recharge your EV when it is 95 degrees outside with 90 percent humidity in Houston. Sounds like great fun! And you'll get 300 miles — whoopee! Many of us drive that in one day. What about the price? I have also readEVs cost, on average, $66,000. That seems affordable to those households making over $200,000 per year, which is6.7 percent of American consumers. Sounds very affordable to so many, correct? Oh, and lastly, Tomlinson states that the vehicles may be charged at night. I see videos online of thosevehicles exploding in flames, and I don’t think they are photoshopped. I still can’t wait until I get mine! Tom Miltenberger, Missouri City In 2020, some276 million vehicleswere registered in the United States. As of 2020, there areover a million EVson U.S. roads. They all need charging stations that should be powered by fossil fuels, some wind and solar with some nuclear energy mixed in. Factor in the EVs that are made and used by Peterbuilt, Mack, Union Pacific, Boeing, Air Force One, the military (such as the M1 Abrams gas turbine main battle tank), container ships coming to the port of Houston, so on. Are we kidding ourselves? We will need that gas, diesel and Jet A fuel for a long time. George Gould, LaMarque Regarding ""Wind and solar boom set to go into high gear,"" (Dec. 30): With more use of clean energy being the bandwagon of the moment, the growing use of solar farms in Texas is a concern to me. We love the touted open spaces yet we cheer the growth of solar farms, which encroach on the open spaces. Why not use all the roofs of urban area buildings for these farms? Are we missing an opportunity? John Kolodczak, Newark, Del. (with Texas roots in Plantersville) Regarding ""Economic woes, war, climate change on tap for Davos meeting,"" (Jan. 16): I was watching the recent World Economic Forum, and was astounded by the hypocrisy that abounds. There were 2,000 plus participants,half of which arrived in private jetsbut espoused saving the environment with their green energy proposals. Then they want to keep everyone from eating meat, but have huge plates of beef and other meats served atexpensive dinners. Could these people be any more hypocritical? The world would be better served if they gave their money to those countries in need, rather than working towards restricting them from using the fossil fuels they need for their betterment. Maybe those at the WEF are naive, but I think that they all have an ulterior motive. Look at the companies that both Al Gore and John Kerry benefit from. They have become uber-rich from their ecological proselytizing. And yes, they do fly around in some really nice private jets. But I guess that is OK so long as you talk the good talk.

14,"Nearly half of U.S. car buyers plan to go electric in next two years, report finds","Analysts at Ernst and Young surveyed 1,500 U.S. consumers in March and found that 48 percent of vehicle buyers plan to purchase an EV – representing a nearly 20 percent jump from last year’s survey. Nearly half of U.S. consumers who plan to buy a car in the next two years say they’ll go electric, according to a new report from consulting firm Ernst and Young. Analysts atErnst and Young surveyed 1,500 U.S. consumersin March and found that 48 percent of vehicle buyers plan to purchase an EV – representing a nearly 20 percent jump from last year’s survey. Texas is already one of the fastest growing states for EV adoption, recently hitting200,000 electric vehicle registrations in the state, according to an analysis from Dallas-Fort Worth Clean Cities. Houston drivers account for nearly a quarter of EV registrations in the states. EV ROAD TRIPS:See how Tesla and other popular models perform on a Texas road trip Despite enthusiasm for EVs among buyers, concerns about access to charging stations persists. Just over half of U.S. consumers surveyed by Ernst and Young said they were concerned about finding charging stations. “Consumers need access to safe, reliable, convenient and affordable charging to drive and own an EV, and our research shows real concerns remain,” Marc Coltelli, Americas leader of electric mobility at Ernst and Young, said in a statement. “To scale adoption, the challenge confronting America’s transition to EVs is instilling charging confidence among consumers.” In the recent Texas legislative session, lawmakers passed two measures,Senate Bills 1001 and 1002, aimed at increasing charging stations in the state. Already charging stations have been popping up at major grocery stores and gas stations. MORE ON EVs:The Houston Chronicle’s EV Buyer’s Guide Moving away from gasoline powered cars to electric vehicles is a major pillar in fighting climate change. Around28 percent of  greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. come from transportation, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. But electricity experts say upgrades must be made to the power grid so it can support the additional use. University of Houston Energy Fellow Ed Hirs said for the moment the Texas grid can handle the number of EVs on the road, but if the rate of EV adoption continues to increase – which Hirs said he expects – then it will change the characteristics of electricity demand on the grid. “We ordinarily see demand fall off during the evening hours,” Hirs said. “I’m expecting that over time we will see the demand begin to (rise) incrementally at night due to the addition of home charging.” Hirs said more utility scale batteries, which are currently negligible butgrowing rapidly in Texas, will likely help balance that demand.
