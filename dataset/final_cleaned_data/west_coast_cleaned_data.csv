That prompted howls of “I told you so” from those who think the electrification of everything from home appliances to cars is a left-wing pipe dream, especially in light of California’s mandate requiring 100% of all new vehicle sales to be zero-emission by 2035.', 'Nor am I part of the problem because of the worries expressed ad nauseum by EV skeptics, few of which have much merit.', 'Yes, driving distance is an issue, but only for a tiny percentage of trips.', 'Yes, my electricity bill is higher, but the additional cost is far lower than what drivers pay for gas.', 'Yes, apartment and condo dwellers who cannot plug in at night have legitimate concerns, because they must rely on our public charging infrastructure — which is growing.', 'Yes, EVs have a carbon footprint, but still typically much smaller than those of gas cars. On this, the evidence is so compelling that it’s hard to imagine survival on this planet unless we immediately replace gas-powered autos with electric ones. Consequently, if the state and federal governments want to take meaningful action on climate change, they have no choice but to subsidize EV buyers.', 'And that’s part of the problem. In the end, an electric car is still, well, a car — and mass car ownership has devastating environmental consequences beyond tailpipe emissions.', 'I became part of this car culture in 2018, after The Times moved from downtown L.A. to El Segundo. Until then I was a dedicated transit commuter and even held out for months after The Times’ relocation. But five hours a day on buses and trains eventually got to me, so I leased a Nissan Leaf.', 'Then a funny thing happened: Some well-meaning people reacted as if I had done the world a favor. Never mind the loss of a transit user to 60-mile daily drives — I had become an EV operator, once pitied for bus riding, now praised for driving.', 'But electric vehicles, like gas-powered cars, require vast expanses of concrete and asphalt for automotive use. This paving over of entire regions has turned neighborhoods into heat sinks that soak up energy from the sun during the day and release it at night — not exactly what we want in an era of accelerating climate change.', 'And electric vehicles, like gas-powered cars, force their drivers to sit in the same traffic jams as everyone else, often on freeways that required the bulldozing of long-established, minority communities to be built. In Downey, locals are fighting a highway expansion plan that would displace residents from more than 200 homes. I haven’t asked, but something tells me “yeah, but more electric cars” wouldn’t convince those residents to give up fighting for their homes.', 'And electric vehicles, like gas-powered cars, needlessly kill people. In the city of Los Angeles, a record 294 people were killed in traffic in 2021. Inadequate infrastructure is largely to blame, but so is the increasing size of cars — and electric cars are getting bigger too, to make them more appealing to American consumers.', 'This isn’t to say there aren’t benefits to replacing dirty vehicles with zero-emission ones. Cities need to curb air pollution, and electric cars cause very little of it. Children living near freeways have higher rates of asthma, and trading internal combustion engines for electric motors would certainly help them.', 'But replacing one kind of car for another isn’t enough if cities like Los Angeles want to be anything other than traffic-choked dystopias. Right now, subsidizing EV ownership to the tune of nearly $10,000 off a car’s sticker price (in California) may be necessary to reduce the acceleration of climate change, but it’s also just a Band-Aid to buy time for systemic change to take hold.', 'And what kind of systemic change would that be? Build out a big public transit system (L.A. is trying), and make it free, reliable and safe. Subsidize the purchase of electric bikes, which make it easier to commute longer distances on devices that use considerably less power and road space than electric cars. Think more of what people in neighborhoods need than what people driving through those neighborhoods want.', 'And for the love of God, shelter every bus stop on every block, so riders don’t risk sunstroke when they take transit during a heat wave.']",latimes,west-coast,started driving electric vehicle 2018 became part problem reason cited ev critic recent heat wave state asked electric car charged peak demand prompted howl told think electrification everything home appliance car leftwing pipe dream especially light californias mandate requiring 100 new vehicle sale zeroemission 2035 part problem worry expressed ad nauseum ev skeptic much merit yes driving distance issue tiny percentage trip yes electricity bill higher additional cost far lower driver pay gas yes apartment condo dweller plug night legitimate concern must rely public charging infrastructure growing yes ev carbon footprint still typically much smaller gas car evidence compelling hard imagine survival planet unless immediately replace gaspowered auto electric one consequently state federal government want take meaningful action climate change choice subsidize ev buyer that is part problem end electric car still well car mass car ownership devastating environmental consequence beyond tailpipe emission became part car culture 2018 times moved downtown la el segundo dedicated transit commuter even held month times relocation five hour day bus train eventually got leased nissan leaf funny thing happened wellmeaning people reacted done world favor never mind loss transit user 60mile daily drive become ev operator pitied bus riding praised driving electric vehicle like gaspowered car require vast expanse concrete asphalt automotive use paving entire region turned neighborhood heat sink soak energy sun day release night exactly want era accelerating climate change electric vehicle like gaspowered car force driver sit traffic jam everyone else often freeway required bulldozing longestablished minority community built downey local fighting highway expansion plan would displace resident 200 home have not asked something tell yeah electric car would not convince resident give fighting home electric vehicle like gaspowered car needlessly kill people city los angeles record 294 people killed traffic 2021 inadequate infrastructure largely blame increasing size car electric car getting bigger make appealing american consumer is not say are not benefit replacing dirty vehicle zeroemission one cities need curb air pollution electric car because little children living near freeway higher rate asthma trading internal combustion engine electric motor would certainly help replacing one kind car another is not enough city like los angeles want anything trafficchoked dystopia right subsidizing ev ownership tune nearly 10000 car sticker price california may necessary reduce acceleration climate change also bandaid buy time systemic change take hold kind systemic change would build big public transit system la trying make free reliable safe subsidize purchase electric bike make easier commute longer distance device use considerably le power road space electric car think people neighborhood need people driving neighborhood want love god shelter every bus stop every block rider do not risk sunstroke take transit heat wave ,09-17-2022
1, Op-Ed: Think bigger. Switching to electric cars isn’t enough ,"['It might feel like the easy solution — just replace your gas-guzzling SUV with an electric SUV, and if everyone does that, eventually we’ll solve climate change. You can see why California regulators decided last month that by 2035, all new cars sold in the state must be electric. After all, car exhaust is the single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in California, so surely switching gas-powered cars to electric ones will make a huge dent in fighting climate change.', 'Except it doesn’t. For starters, electric cars still pollute. They don’t have tailpipe emissions, but the process of producing and transporting them creates pollution. According to the International Energy Agency, the average gas-powered car will create 41.9 tons of CO2 emissions from the point it’s manufactured until it’s retired, in contrast to 21.1 tons of CO2 from an EV. In other words, while the average EV will pollute about 50% less compared  with a gas-powered car, it’s still highly polluting.', 'There’s also pollution, and other harms, that come before the manufacturing stage, especially in the intensifying global competition to procure rare earth materials (concentrated in China) for EV batteries. In the past, we have often been dependent on the Middle East for oil. Do we want to create a future in which we’re again dependent on countries that may not be aligned with our values for required materials for our transportation system?', 'The second issue is power capacity. During the first week in September, California faced a historic heat wave, and alerts were issued asking EV owners to not charge their vehicles during peak times. And this is at a time when only 1.9% of cars operating in California are EVs. What happens when that number is 5%? Or 20%? Without a dramatic increase in power production from clean sources, it won’t be possible to supply power to all the EVs without ramping up use of coal and natural gas for electricity generation, increasing emissions from fossil fuels.', 'There are some bottom lines that are true whether cars are powered by fossil fuels or electricity:', 'Electric cars are just as dangerous for people outside the car; if you get hit by a 9,000-pound electric Hummer or a 7,000-pound gas Hummer, you’re dead either way. EVs are just as dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists as their gas-powered cousins, and rushing to adopt them without changing the way we use space on our streets is a recipe for a continued upward trend of pedestrian, cyclist and driver deaths.', 'Electric cars take up the same amount of space as gas-powered cars; even if we could wave a wand and convert every car on the road today to an EV, traffic would still be miserable, and the demand for driving and parking space would continue to suck the lifeblood out of our cities.', 'Additionally, car-based infrastructure is very expensive. In 1982, President Reagan signed a law that allocated 80% of the Highway Trust Fund to highways, and 20% to public transportation. This means the country built and maintains an extraordinarily expensive roadway network at the expense of quality high-speed trains and investments in other non-car infrastructure. In 2019, we spent $203 billion nationwide on highways and roads, and that amount is low compared to what is needed. (The highway trust fund doesn’t actually cover all the maintenance costs of highways, and we haven’t raised the federal gas tax since 1993.) ', 'If all cars were electric, we would still spend a disproportionate amount of money building and maintaining car infrastructure, with little left over to build world-class high-speed rail, bus or bike infrastructure inside and between our cities. We would still have outdated parking requirements for developers — which drive up the cost of housing and aggravate sprawl. And because EVs typically weigh more than their gas-powered counterparts, and heavier vehicles wear down the road faster, we will need to spend even more money on maintenance over the long term.', 'Electric cars aren’t a panacea to solve climate change. They can be part of the solution, but a myopic focus on electric cars as the solution prevents us from seeing so many other ideas. We need a future with fewer cars (electric or not) and much more public transit and bike usage. We need a complete rethink of how we use our public space, and better infrastructure so people can take short trips without using a car.', 'There are no shortcuts to solving climate change. We shouldn’t assume that once every gas-powered car is replaced with an electric one, we’ll solve the problem — because we won’t. We should instead put our energy into redoing how we use our road space, to truly curb pollution and needless death and bring life back into our cities.', 'Michael Schneider is the founder of Streets for All.']",latimes,west-coast,might feel like easy solution replace gasguzzling suv electric suv everyone eventually well solve climate change see california regulator decided last month 2035 new car sold state must electric car exhaust single biggest source greenhouse gas emission california surely switching gaspowered car electric one make huge dent fighting climate change except does not starter electric car still pollute do not tailpipe emission process producing transporting creates pollution according international energy agency average gaspowered car create 419 ton co2 emission point manufactured retired contrast 211 ton co2 ev word average ev pollute 50 le compared gaspowered car still highly polluting there is also pollution harm come manufacturing stage especially intensifying global competition procure rare earth material concentrated china ev battery past often dependent middle east oil want create future dependent country may aligned value required material transportation system second issue power capacity first week september california faced historic heat wave alert issued asking ev owner charge vehicle peak time time 19 car operating california ev happens number 5 20 without dramatic increase power production clean source will not possible supply power ev without ramping use coal natural gas electricity generation increasing emission fossil fuel bottom line true whether car powered fossil fuel electricity electric car dangerous people outside car get hit 9000pound electric hummer 7000pound gas hummer you are dead either way ev dangerous pedestrian cyclist gaspowered cousin rushing adopt without changing way use space street recipe continued upward trend pedestrian cyclist driver death electric car take amount space gaspowered car even could wave wand convert every car road today ev traffic would still miserable demand driving parking space would continue suck lifeblood city additionally carbased infrastructure expensive 1982 president reagan signed law allocated 80 highway trust fund highway 20 public transportation mean country built maintains extraordinarily expensive roadway network expense quality highspeed train investment noncar infrastructure 2019 spent 203 billion nationwide highway road amount low compared needed highway trust fund does not actually cover maintenance cost highway have not raised federal gas tax since 1993 car electric would still spend disproportionate amount money building maintaining car infrastructure little left build worldclass highspeed rail bus bike infrastructure inside city would still outdated parking requirement developer drive cost housing aggravate sprawl ev typically weigh gaspowered counterpart heavier vehicle wear road faster need spend even money maintenance long term electric car are not panacea solve climate change part solution myopic focus electric car solution prevents you seeing many idea need future fewer car electric much public transit bike usage need complete rethink use public space better infrastructure people take short trip without using car shortcut solving climate change should not assume every gaspowered car replaced electric one well solve problem will not instead put energy redoing use road space truly curb pollution needle death bring life back city michael schneider founder streets ,09-15-2022
2," Editorial: EPA wants to speed up EV switch. Good, the planet needs it ","['The Biden administration just proposed hitting the accelerator on the transition to electric vehicles. If these ambitious new rules are enacted, the U.S. could make major progress in fighting climate change.', 'The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday released new pollution standards for passenger cars and trucks that would be the strongest vehicle emission regulations to date. To comply, automakers would have to significantly increase the number of electric vehicles they produce over the next decade.', 'That would be a huge change in the vehicle market, which has slowly been rolling out zero-emission models. Last year, about 6% of passenger cars and trucks sold were electric. The proposed emission limits are so strict, the EPA expects that about 67% of passenger vehicles sold by 2032 would be electric in order to meet the standards. ', ' Opinion ', 'Not many electric vehicles in the U.S. will be eligible for federal subsidies under Inflation Reduction Act guidelines due to battery and minerals sourcing restrictions.', 'April 5, 2023', 'The proposal would also transform the commercial sector,  in which there are now few electric models on the roads. By 2032, about half of new buses, garbage trucks and delivery vans sold would have to be electric, and  25% to 35% of new heavy-duty trucks would be zero-emission models. ', 'Swapping out that many combustion engines would slash planet-warming pollution from the transportation sector, which is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. The EPA projects the regulations would avoid putting into the atmosphere nearly 10 billion tons of carbon emissions, which is the equivalent of two times the total U.S. carbon emissions in 2022.', 'These vehicle pollution standards could be one of the  United States’ most important steps in staving off the most devastating effects of global warming and reducing exposure to unhealthful pollution — if the regulations are put into place. As of now, they are just proposals and need to go through a public comment period before the EPA adopts the regulations, which are expected to become final next year and begin to apply to 2027 model-year vehicles. ', 'Auto industry representatives have raised concern that the EPA’s proposal may be too much, too fast. The rules would go further than Biden’s previous goal of having half of all cars sold in 2030 be electric.', ' Opinion ', 'U.N. climate report shows we can’t just phase out oil and gas; we have to deliberately dismantle existing infrastructure, such as coal plants in China and drilling in Alaska. ', 'March 21, 2023', 'There are legitimate questions about supply chain readiness, including the availability of materials used in battery manufacturing, which could drive up the price of EVs. There are also real worries about whether the U.S. will have the charging stations and electric grid capability to power all those new EVs. Cost and the lack of charging stations are key reasons why 60% of consumers said they are not likely to buy an electric car as their next vehicle, according to a recent survey.', 'Those are challenges that must be addressed more urgently. But that doesn’t mean the EPA should wait for all problems to be solved before pressing ahead with aggressive vehicle emissions standards. Regulations drive results, and the planet needs results quickly.', 'A United Nations report released last month warned the planet is on track to blow past 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, a critical threshold virtually every nation on Earth has agreed to work to avoid to prevent greater harm from climate change. To avoid that fate, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the world needs to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2035.', 'Reaching that requires transforming the transportation sector.

Much is unknown about life on the deep sea floor, and vacuuming swaths of it clean threatens to have unintended and far-reaching consequences.', 'The drama playing out in the deep sea is just one act in a fast unfolding, ethically challenging and economically complex debate that stretches around the world, from the cobalt mines of Congo to the corridors of the Biden White House to fragile desert habitats throughout the West where vast deposits of lithium lay beneath the ground.', 'ABOUT THIS SERIES', 'No state has had a bigger impact on the direction of the United States than California, a prolific incubator and exporter of outside-the-box policies and ideas. This occasional series examines what that has meant for the state and the country, and how far Washington is willing to go to spread California’s agenda as the state’s own struggles threaten its standing as the nation’s think tank.', 'The state of California is inexorably intertwined in this drama. Not just because extraction companies are aggressively surveying the state’s landscapes for opportunities to mine and process the materials. But because California is leading the drive toward electric cars.', 'No state has exported more policy innovations — including on climate, equality, the economy — than California, a trend accelerating under the Biden administration. The state relishes its role as the nation’s think tank, though the course it charts for the country has, at times, veered in unanticipated directions. ', '“The ocean is the place on the planet where we know least about what species exist and how they function,” Douglas McCauley, a marine science professor at UC Santa Barbara, said of plans to scrape the seafloor. “This is like opening a Pandora’s box.... We’re concerned this won’t do much good for climate change, but it will do irreversible harm to the ocean.”', 'The sprint to supply automakers with heavy-duty lithium batteries is propelled by climate-conscious countries like the United States that aspire to abandon gas-powered cars and SUVs. They are racing to secure the materials needed to go electric, and the Biden administration is under pressure to fast-track mammoth extraction projects that threaten to unleash their own environmental fallout.', 'In far-flung patches of the ocean floor, at Native American ancestral sites, and on some of the most pristine federal lands, extraction and mining companies are branding themselves stewards of sustainability, warning the planet will suffer if digging and scraping are delayed. All the prospecting is giving pause to some of the environmental groups championing climate action, as they assess whether the sacrifice needed to curb warming is being shared fairly.', '“A lot of people see sagebrush and they think…what’s the value in this?” says environmental activist Max Wilbert. “ You have to be willing to wait and be patient because at this time of the day, all the wildlife, all the action, they’re hiding there in the shade.” (Video by Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times)', '“Front-line communities affected by mining are asking the rest of us: What sacrifice are you making?” said John Hadder, executive director of Great Basin Resource Watch, a Nevada group fighting a proposed massive lithium mine at Thacker Pass, near the Oregon border. “You are asking us to have our community and environment permanently disrupted. All you are doing is maybe driving a different car.”', 'California began plotting in 1990 to force car manufacturers to make zero- emission vehicles. The cars were so undesired when they began rolling off assembly lines by the early 2010s that they were tagged “compliance cars” — built and sold only to comply with California mandates. ', 'Yet California, the global trendsetter on cutting tailpipe emissions, kept pushing — until electric cars became not only functional, but stylish. Next year, 500 electric vehicle models will be sold worldwide.', '“California’s policies created these markets,” said Matt Petersen, president of the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator. ', 'By 2035, California will ban the sale of gas-powered cars in an effort to address climate change and push drivers toward electric vehicles.

Need for these materials could soar by 600% globally over the next two decades, according to the International Energy Agency. ', 'Electric cars account for 1.7 million vehicle sales annually worldwide, and that number could soar to 8.5 million by 2025, Bloomberg New Energy Finance projects. The transformation is happening quickest in Europe and China — where more than 20% of cars sold will be electric by 2025. California aims to hit similar numbers by then, even as the rest of the U.S. moves more slowly.  ', 'The success of electric cars is a point of pride for not just California, but the Biden administration, which is trying to meet the commitments in the Paris climate accord. But it is also a point of panic. The administration warns the transition threatens to leave the nation vulnerable to the whims of countries that control supply chains. President Biden in June ordered the Departments of Energy and the Interior to help industry bolster mining and processing of battery materials.', 'China controls most of the market for the raw-material refining needed for the batteries and dominates component manufacturing; industry analysts warn the monopolization presents not only an economic risk, but also a national security one.

That much is clear in Thacker Pass, a windswept pocket of northern Nevada where the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe has for centuries hunted sage grouse, collected plants for medicine, and gathered for ceremonies. It is also the largest reserve of lithium in the United States.', 'A mining permit pushed through in the last week of the Trump administration allows the Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp. to produce enough lithium carbonate annually to supply nearly a million electric car batteries. The mine pit alone would disrupt more than 1,100 acres, and the whole operation — on land leased from the federal government — would cover roughly six times that. Up to 5,800 tons of sulfuric acid would be used daily to leach lithium from the earth dug out of a 300-foot deep mine pit. ', 'Tribal members and some ranchers are fighting the plans, alarmed by details in the environmental impact assessment: The operation would generate hundreds of millions of cubic yards of mining waste and lower the water table in this high desert region by churning through 3,200 gallons per minute. Arsenic contamination of the water under the mine pit could endure 300 years.', 'Pronghorn antelope roam amid the sagebrush that spreads for miles in Thacker Pass, nestled between the Montana and Double H mountain ranges. The sound of fierce winds is interrupted by the occasional call of a brown eagle or screech of a hawk.

The trade-offs for the jobs mining brought to Nevada’s Humboldt County, they said, were cancer clusters, water and air contamination and broken promises to clean up the land. ', 'Now tribal members are working with environmental activists, many of whom are living in a protest camp set up the day the Thacker Pass permit was approved in January.', '“They would come in here with explosives, with heavy earthmoving equipment, and they would begin by scraping off everything that we can see here,” Max Wilbert, a leader of the protest camp, said as he gestured toward sagebrush stretching to the horizon.

The International Seabed Authority is only permitting the Metals Co. and select other operations to collect polymetallic nodules and conduct scientific research in a few dozen experimentation zones as the authority considers commercial-scale harvesting.', '“Every single part of this nodule I hold in my hand is usable material,” said Barron, the company CEO, as he showcased one of the rocks from the giant ship that had just returned from its six-week expedition in a remote region of the Pacific called the Clarion Clipperton Zone.', '“It’s like having an [electric vehicle] battery in a rock, and they lie on the ocean floor unattached,” Barron said. “Compare that to the alternative on land, where we’re having to rip down our forests, our trees, our plants, dig up our soils, to get to metal. That has enormous unintended consequences.”', 'The company estimates that nodules on just a small fraction of the ocean floor could supply the nickel, cobalt, copper and manganese needed to build 280 million electric vehicle batteries — enough to power every car and SUV on the road in America. It’s a potent marketing point in the context of the environmental injustice unfolding at land-based mining operations.', 'The Metals Co. points as an example to cobalt, a key component of the batteries. More than half the world’s supply comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where children are exploited for cheap labor. Amnesty International estimates some 40,000 children are working in the country’s cobalt mines.', '“A person buying an electric vehicle is probably not that aware of the fact that children are mining for their batteries in the DRC,” said Bramley Murton, a marine geology professor at the National Oceanography Center in Southampton, England. Murton cautions against ruling out industrial-scale harvesting of ocean nodules.', '“Unless the whole of civilization is going back to the Dark Ages and using horses and carts, we need these raw materials,” he said. “We have to get them somewhere.”', 'It’s a complicated endeavor for many of the scientists on board the Metals Co. ship, who are not necessarily bullish on the firm’s plans to start scraping the seabed by 2024. But there are few other opportunities for ocean scientists to collect samples and conduct research that far and deep in the ocean. It is a costly undertaking. The Metals Co., known as DeepGreen prior to an ongoing merger with deep-pocketed investors, is spending $100 million on an environmental impact study it hopes to use to convince the seabed authority that its plans are sound.', '“I am not for mining and I am not against it,” said Andrew K. Sweetman, a professor of earth, marine science and technology at Heriot-Watt University in Scotland who was on the most recent Metals Co. expedition. Sweetman was overseeing collection of samples from a bulky high-tech machine that drops more than two miles into the sea and might best be described as the underwater cousin to the InSight lander that NASA sent to Mars.', 'The contraption is enabling scientists to learn how organisms function in a corner of the Earth that is scarcely better understood than much of outer space.', '“I’m getting the best environmental data that we can,” Sweetman said. The seabed authority will ultimately use that data to make its ruling. “At least I know at that point that they have the best information that they can have to make that decision.”', 'Others are less confident.', 'The seabed authority is being forced to cram its decision-making into a two-year time frame after Nauru — one of 167 member nations — recently triggered a clause in the authority’s charter allowing it to fast-track a decision. Nauru’s partnership with the Metals Co. presents the prospect of a financial windfall for the tiny Pacific island nation. ', '“Bureaucracy can get in the way of progress,” said Barron, the company CEO. “Climate change is an existential crisis. We do not have the luxury of sitting around for decades to dwell on these impacts.”', 'Yet many scientists say there are any number of deep-sea life forms that are too little known for debate to even begin. They warn that the plumes kicked up by harvesting machines could destroy ecosystems, damage the seafood industry and kill off critical organisms that could take lifetimes to come back, if they ever do.', 'When one deep-sea creature made its debut to humankind five years ago, the charismatic, milky white octopus quickly became a social media sensation. Its resemblance to a playful cartoon ghost earned the marine mollusk the name Casper.', 'The prospects for Casper are not great if the demand for electric vehicle batteries sparks a frenzy of deep sea harvesting. The octopus lays its eggs on sponges attached to the nodules metal companies are so eager to scrape from the ocean floor.', '“We don’t know what is down there,” said Andy Whitmore, an officer at the Deep Sea Mining Campaign, which is pushing for a ban on seabed mining. “There has not been enough exploration and understanding of what life there is, how it is linked to higher life forms and what happens if you remove the nodules sustaining these organisms.”', 'Start your day right ', 'Sign up for Essential California for the L.A.

5, Can California’s electric-vehicle push overcome the red-state backlash? ,"['This industrial city an hour north of Indianapolis isn’t as famous as Detroit, but it has become an unlikely battleground in the war over electric cars. ', 'Almost everyone you meet here either works in a factory, is retired from one or has a relative in a plant that makes parts for gasoline-powered cars — which have ruled Kokomo for nearly 130 years, since a brash inventor named Elwood Haynes chugged down Pumpkinvine Pike at 7 mph in one of America’s first horseless carriages.', '“We haven’t developed a workforce towards anything else yet,” said Warren Sims, a 41-year-old worker in the same casting plant that employs his father, working on gas transmission engines. “We don’t make a fuel-efficient vehicle. Everything’s big and everything costs [a lot to] fuel and people buy it.” ', 'Yet change is coming. Bulldozers are clearing Kokomo’s cornfields to build a $2.5-billion government-subsidized electric vehicle battery factory, with the aim of retaining jobs tied to auto production at a time California is leading the nation in phasing out gas-powered engines.', 'Environmentalists, along with industry and government leaders, see a transformation afoot after decades of false starts. They have acknowledged, however, that they can’t complete the shift if electric cars are viewed as something only for rich liberals in California and New York. They need everyone.', 'The uneasy reception to EVs in Indiana — in a national climate that includes Republican lawsuits against California’s new emissions rules and televised warnings that they represent an attack on freedom — suggests that the country remains divided over embracing a technology that environmentalists say is essential to combating climate change.', 'Dec. 6, 2022', 'Indiana can feel like a tough place to own an electric car.', 'Major cities are located far apart, with few charging stations in between. The vehicles that dominate the landscape — American-branded pickup trucks — are just beginning to be offered in electric versions. And the most popular EVs remain out of reach for many consumers in places where incomes tend to be lower. The charging stations at the Meijer grocery store parking lot in Kokomo sit empty for hours.', 'The state is also deep red. And Republicans are much less likely than Democrats to consider buying an EV, according to a poll conducted for The Times by Leger, a Canadian-based polling firm with extensive experience in U.S. surveys.', ' Politics ', 'Electric cars, climate credit schemes, diverse boardrooms and legal weed: How California exports its ideas and policies across the U.S.', 'Nov. 15, 2021', 'Conservative media figures have tried to amplify those divisions, portraying Biden administration credits for EVs as cash for “the coastal elite who rule the Democratic Party” (Erick Erickson) and part of a utopian vision to “make children in Africa de facto slaves to make Pete Buttigieg’s dream come true” (Charles Payne).', '“They think you’re a bunch of racists polluting the planet, so you don’t deserve to have real choices,” Fox News host Laura Ingraham said after California’s Air Resources Board voted to halt sales of new gas-powered cars in the state by 2035. “It’s an effort to get you used to living with less — less prosperity and less freedom.”', 'Indiana’s Todd Rokita is one of 17 attorneys general, all Republicans, suing the Biden administration in an attempt to block California’s right to set its own emissions standards.', '“It’s gonna wreck the economy,” Rokita said. “The ideology is [failing], when you mandate electric cars but don’t have the power to run them.”', 'The Kokomo VFW parking lot is filled with hulking trucks, tricked-out Jeeps — and skepticism about the country’s turn toward electric vehicles.', '“It’s stupid. I don’t believe in it, especially the way they’re doing it,” said John Meeks, the 72-year-old commander of Kokomo’s Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 1152. “They’re shoving it down your throat.”', 'But U.S. automakers, after resisting electrification for decades, now are betting money and marketing clout that they can get everyone to buy an EV, especially as they introduce more lower-priced models. And the Biden administration is spending $135 billion on a national charging network, manufacturing grants, consumer subsidies and other projects to put electric vehicles at the center of its agenda, the president’s most ambitious attempt to slow climate change.', 'To get there, they’ll need to attract more people like Jen Cecil, a 38-year-old Kokomo office manager who owns a Mustang Mach-E.', '“I’m not too crazy about, you know, the ‘go green’ or, you know, ‘you suck at life’ ” if you don’t buy an EV, said Cecil, a Republican. “That kind of gets us a bad name. I just really enjoyed the car.”', 'While many of Indiana’s leaders aren’t cheerleaders for California’s phaseout of gas-powered cars, they are eager to promote and expand the electric-vehicle industry here: sponsoring research, traveling to Asia to spur business and handing out millions of taxpayer dollars to manufacturers.', 'Kokomo Mayor Tyler Moore drives a gas-powered Jeep Cherokee and envisions a future in which gas, electric and hybrid cars coexist. But he also offered tax breaks and free farmland to the joint-venture EV battery plant being built by Stellantis and Samsung. Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge, already runs four powertrain factories in Kokomo and a fifth in nearby Tipton. Kokomo needs the jobs. The surrounding county lost more than 2,000 manufacturing positions from 2017 to 2021, a drop of nearly 20% in that sector.', 'And Indiana’s Republican governor, Eric Holcomb, has given the Kokomo factory up to $186.5 million in incentives; he also met with Samsung officials in South Korea over the summer during an economic development mission.', 'Jodi Tinson, a Stellantis spokeswoman, said the company plans to reach 50% EV sales by 2030 and is “committed to continuing to give our employees opportunities to succeed … in a bold new era.” Stellantis is investing millions to retool some of its plants to make hybrid and plug-in components, but it’s unclear which will survive if and when the company goes all electric.', 'The industry is generally choosing to build EVs on new sites rather than retooling old ones because, over time, manufacturers will save money with more streamlined operations, said Zack Krelle, an analyst with TrueCar, a website for pricing and buying vehicles.', 'Electric vehicles eventually are expected to require less factory labor to build because they have fewer parts. That is a source of unease for many workers at Kokomo’s Stellantis plants.', '“It’s more computers and robots,” said John Brumfiel, 50, who works maintenance at a transmission plant. “Less workers.”', 'Hoosiers’ concerns about electric cars aren’t limited to how the vehicles will affect their livelihoods.', 'At the VFW, many people — including some retired plant workers — said they were not ready to drive an EV because of cost, charging time or range. Several people in town pointed out that California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, announced the 2035 deadline even as the state was struggling with an energy crisis, underscoring their concerns over reliability and with the country’s electric capacity.', '“Gavin Newsom says, ‘We want to have these battery-electric cars,’ ” said David Sedam, 70, a retired General Motors engineer. “But then he comes out and says, ‘Oh, by the way, don’t use too much electricity.’ ”', 'Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican whom donors and pundits have mentioned as a potential presidential candidate, tried to channel some of that skepticism when he announced over the summer that he wanted his state to drop its adherence to California’s fuel standards.', '“That’s just wholly unacceptable to allow an unelected body in California to decide what cars Virginians are going to buy,” Youngkin said in an interview a few weeks later.', 'Residents of some of the bluest states — California, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii and Vermont — are more than twice as likely to shop for electric vehicles as those in redder states such as Indiana and Kentucky, according to a report from TrueCar.', 'But even ambitious GOP politicians such as Youngkin have to tread carefully when it comes to electric cars.', 'Many of the states that stand to get the biggest boost from the Biden administration’s investment in batteries lean Republican. In October, the administration announced $2.8 billion in industry grants in 12 states from the bipartisan infrastructure law. Among them: Tennessee, Alabama, Missouri, Georgia, Louisiana. Car and battery companies are spending billions more to build or expand plants in North Carolina, Ohio and Kansas.', 'Kentucky, the home state of Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, is poised to employ about twice as many people in EV jobs as coal mines.', 'Republican states fought for a decade against President Obama’s expansion of Medicaid. But all 50 states — even the GOP ones — have already submitted plans to be part of the national EV charging network Biden announced this year. There is little evidence so far that conservative politicians would stake their political futures on the issue, even if they nod to anti-Biden talking points.', 'Brad Chambers, Indiana Gov. Holcomb’s economic development chief, doesn’t think campaign attack ads targeting electric vehicles would have much of a shelf life.', '“Some people will probably try it,” he said. “In the long run, I think it’s going to be like everything else in our society is going to be — what’s the good product?”', 'Sedam, the retired GM engineer, who drives a Chevy pickup, worries about his son and other autoworkers who still depend on the traditional industry. Still, the Democrat-turned-Trump voter sees electric cars as the future, albeit a more distant one than proponents project.', '”I’m not against a new green deal, but the problem I have is I don’t think we have the technology for the batteries so far,” he said.Industry analysts see the partisan divide on EVs, but say age may be just as telling. The Leger/L.A. Times poll found people between the ages of 18 and 34 were far more likely (49%) to consider buying an EV than people over 55 (14%).', 'Abigail Fuller, who lives near Kokomo in a town called Gas City, said price — not politics — was her only consideration in buying her Chevy Malibu.', '“Gas prices are extremely expensive right now,” said Fuller, a 28-year-old Republican. “If I could get an electric car, I probably would.”', 'This summer, Dodge — looking to expand the potential EV customer base to those who like classic muscle cars — showed off an electric concept during “Speed Week” in Pontiac, Mich., with flashing lights, pounding music, billowing clouds of smoke and promises to break the rules. The pitch was aimed directly at overcoming the elitist tag.', '“This is not the EV they want you to have,” Tim Kuniskis, the brand’s chief executive, said as he demonstrated the Dodge Charger Daytona SRT’s 126-decibel roar and the powerful “Banshee powertrain.”', '“We didn’t ask for the rules to change. We didn’t want them to change, but they did,” Kuniskis said. “We can try to outrun them. But that would be a … path straight into extinction.”', 'Rodney Kidd, 35, has tattoos and wears a hunting cap with a rifle on it. He is a self-described rural conservative gear-head. He’s also something of an EV evangelist.', 'The lab technician and his colleagues at the Battery Innovation Center, about 90 minutes south of Indianapolis, are researching how to commercialize battery technology. Among the biggest concerns he hears from friends when the topic of EVs comes up is that charging stations in Indiana are clustered in big cities such as Bloomington and Indianapolis, making it hard to traverse sprawling rural areas.', 'When that changes, rural Americans’ resistance to electric vehicles will too, Kidd said.', 'He pointed out that he owns a diesel truck he uses for towing and pulling. Battery trucks will do the job better because of their superior torque, he said. Larger electric vehicles have advantages in underground coal mines. EVs will eventually change car racing too, he said, even if some of “the haters” may never accept them.', 'Ultimately, electric cars will win not because of blue state mandates, but because they’re a

6,"Environmental groups want SF to nudge Uber, Lyft drivers toward electric vehicles","Environmental advocates want San Francisco to find ways to make electric vehicles more attractive to Uber and Lyft drivers at the same time they consider a per-ride tax on the companies that is meant to ease congestion. In recent weeks, at least five organizations, including the Union of Concerned Scientists, Natural Resources Defense Council, Coalition for Clean Air and the San Francisco League of Conservation Voters, have sent letters to Mayor London Breed and the Board of Supervisors urging them to include tax breaks to push Uber and Lyft drivers toward zero-emission vehicles. Led by Supervisor Aaron Peskin, city officials are fine-tuning the language of a ballot measure that would tax each Uber and Lyft ride that originates in San Francisco. It’s expected to appear on the Nov. 5 ballotand already has the support of the two ride-hail companies.The measure is expected to place a 3.25 percent tax on single rides and a 1.5 percent tax on shared rides. The San Francisco County Transportation Authority would receive the estimated $30 million in revenue to spend on local transit projects. The environmental groups are advocating for some kind of tax treatment that would reward drivers who use electric vehicles, but exactly how that would work has not been outlined. Their goal is to have the city meet itsgoal of being a net-zero carbon emitterby 2050. But questions remain about how to implement the tax break and how the city would install the charging stations needed if a significant portion of Uber’s and Lyft’s fleets shifted to electric vehicles. It’s not clear how many would be needed, but the city currently has just under 796 publicly available charging ports. “The time for thinking and the time for studying and debate — we’re well past that. We need programs that help us electrify everything,” said Dan Jacobson, state director for Environment California, one of the organizations that wrote to city officials. “Electrifying the car-share rides should be a very low-hanging fruit program we can do here in the city, and one that should be adopted throughout the state.” Much of the tax measure is predicated on a2017 reportfrom the county transportation authority that found that there were around 170,000 ride-hailing trips on a typical San Francisco weekday. Peskin said he’s planning to add a temporary tax incentive for zero-emission vehicles into the ballot measure but emphasized that, at its core, the per-ride tax is intended to raise money for transit projects and reduce congestion attributable to Uber and Lyft. “We want to incentivize zero-emission vehicles, but at the end of the day, we want to dis-incentivize congestion,” Peskin said. “We’re going to give zero-emission vehicles a running head start. We want to incentivize them so they’re encouraged to be part of the Uber and Lyft fleets, but that doesn’t mean they get a tax holiday forever.” Peskin added that he hopes to put the measure on the November ballot with a unanimous vote of the board and the backing of the mayor. “I’m all for it. Any way to incentivize people to go electric, I’m all for it,” said Esther de Frutos,who drives for Uber in San Francisco in her electric Chevy Bolt. The ability to tax Uber and Lyft rides to fund transportation projects was cemented by 2018 legislation authored by Assemblyman Phil Ting, D-San Francisco. His bill, AB1184, included provisions that allowed city officials to create tax breaks for zero-emission vehicles, but didn’t mandate them. “I’m a champion of clean cars,” Ting said. An enticement to move toward zero-emission vehicles, he said, was “something I’d encourage Supervisor Peskin to incorporate” into the ballot measure. Another 2018 bill, from state Sen. Nancy Skinner, D-Berkeley, requires the California Air Resources Board and the California Public Utilities Commission to find ways to increase the number of electric vehicles in the ride-hailing fleets and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions per passenger mile. Both Uber and Lyft have made some attempts to reward their drivers who use electric vehicles. Davis White, Uber’s director of California public affairs, pointed toprogramsthat give drivers a warning if an upcoming rider’s trip might take 30 minutes or more, a nod to the shorter distances most electric vehicles can cover before needing a charge. In some cities, including San Francisco, Uber also gives small cash incentives to electric-vehicle drivers. Last month, Lyft announced its intent to “introduce thousands of electric vehicles onto our platform,” and make it easier to request electric-vehicle rides. It’s not clear how far along the company is toward those goals, as a Lyft spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. Neither environmentalists nor local policymakers have a firm sense of how the zero-emission tax break might actually work. Some have suggested making electric-vehicle rides available each time someone hails an Uber or Lyft ride, or allowing electric-vehicle drivers to keep more of the money from each fare. Though he asked the mayor and the board for the electric-vehicle tax break, Jimmy O’Dea, a senior vehicles analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said whatever is added to Peskin’s ballot measure probably won’t be “a strong enough incentive” to influence drivers’ decisions meaningfully. “But at least it starts a bigger conversation that maybe wasn’t happening before,” he said. “It forces the city’s hand on the (charging station) question. If they portray to be supporting electric-vehicles, they have to go all the way and think about infrastructure as well, and not just a lower rate on the fees they collect.” Dominic Fracassa is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

7,"To cut carbon footprint, SF moves to eliminate vehicle emissions by 2040","San Francisco officials want to shrink the city’s carbon footprint by eliminating the greenhouse gases belched from cars, trucks and other vehicles by 2040. The city will take the first step toward that goal Tuesday, when MayorLondon Breedand SupervisorsVallie BrownandAaron Peskinare expected to introduce legislation to install more electric-vehicle charging stations in both public and private parking lots and garages. Exhaust from cars, trucks and other vehicles represents 46% of all emissions in San Francisco, making transportation the biggest contributor to the city’s carbon footprint. About 44% of emissions come equally from the fuel burned to power and heat commercial and residential buildings, according to the city’s Department of the Environment. City officials have also introduced legislation that would requirelarge commercial property ownersto switch their buildings to 100% renewable energy by 2030. That ordinance is waiting for a hearing before the city’s Land Use Committee. Leaders in San Francisco and across the state are looking to boost the adoption of electric vehicles — and the charging infrastructure needed to encourage drivers to make the switch. In 2018, then-Gov. Jerry Brown signed an executive order calling for 5 million new zero-emission vehicles on California’s roads by 2030 and 250,000 charging stations by 2025. “To meet our climate goals and improve the air we breathe, we need to electrify public and private transportation,” Breed said in a statement. “We know that one of the biggest barriers for people considering driving an electric vehicle is access to charging, so we want to make sure our city has the charging infrastructure that’s needed.” San Francisco’s pending legislation, which city officials believe to be the first of its kind in the country, would require private parking lots and garages with more than 100 parking spots to install electric-vehicle charging stations next to at least 10% of the spaces. The ordinance would apply to about 300 commercial parking facilities in the city whose owners would have until 2023 to install the new stations. Commercial electric-vehicle charging stations can cost thousands of dollars each. But most private lot and garage operators are expected to contract with charging-station providers, so the charging ports don’t have to be bought outright. The city is also looking to grow the stock of charging stations at up to 38 municipally operated lots and garages. Charging-station providers are bidding on the chance to install up to 340 charging ports on city property. The city has installed 200 charging ports on city property since 2009. Beyond installing more charging stations, the city will consider other proposals meant to nudge more people into electric vehicles, including making street and garage parking cheaper for electric cars, finding ways to make at-home charging more affordable, and finding ways to shift heavier vehicles — like school buses and garbage trucks — to all-electric fleets. — Dominic Fracassa  Dominic Fracassa is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

8,"With new grant program, Bay Area spreads electric cars to low-income drivers","This is a carousel. Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate Standing beside his new car, a 2016 Ford C-Max hybrid with an eggshell-white exterior, Ignacio Hernandez beams. Charge the electric battery and it glides for 200 miles, swooshing along the Interstate 880 and Interstate 580 freeways from Hernandez’s home in East Oakland to his job managing a Burger King in Dublin. It purrs so quietly that Hernandez barely hears the motor, and in the long run, it will save him money: His old car, a sputtering, 1996 Toyota Camry, cost thousands of dollars a year for gas and repairs. But purchasing a hybrid was unthinkable until Hernandez got a $9,500 grant from Bay Area Air Quality Management District, through a program that aims to make clean-air vehicles accessible to low-income Californians. “Definitely cost is one of the biggest barriers to getting people in these vehicles,” said Rebecca Fisher, a program manager at the district who is helping steer Clean Cars for All. Funded with state climate investments and money from a one-time $10 million payment from a civil enforcement case against Volkswagen — which agreed to pay billions in penalties after the company admitted to cheating on diesel emissions standards — the program subsidizes new electric vehicles for qualifying motorists willing to scrap their clunkers. The old, polluting cars get hauled to a recycling plant and eviscerated, so their metal shells and parts can be salvaged. California directs a portion of its climate funding toward low-income or “disadvantaged” communities, often located in areas that are heavily polluted by automobiles, said Melanie Turner, a spokeswoman for the state’s Air Resources Board. Aside from helping finance electric vehicles, the state also pays for rural school buses, zero-emission car shares, and van pools to serve agricultural workers, among other projects. The Clean Cars for All program in the Bay Area started in March and has assisted nearly 200 people who were driving old beaters, including some that date to the 1980s, Fisher said. Air districts in Sacramento, Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley have launched similar efforts, all bolstered by the state climate funds. Fisher said the programs can continue in perpetuity if the Legislature approves them in every budget. In the Bay Area, air quality officials hand out grants of up to $9,500 for the purchase of a plug-in vehicle, along with up to $2,000 to install a home charger. To qualify, applicants must meet an income threshold that’s about twice the federal poverty line — a family of four must make less than $58,000 a year to receive the maximum grant. Recipients who choose to buy a new car can also receive a state rebate of $2,500, which won’t apply to purchases of used vehicles. For those who want an alternative to driving, Clean Cars also offers subsidies for Clipper Cards — policymakers hope to expand the program to e-bikes next year. The idea is that efficient transportation can be a means to economic mobility: “We’re providing people who are struggling financially with a more reliable way to get to work,” Fisher said. Officials also want to spread the electric car market beyond Silicon Valley and well-heeled Bay Area suburbs. Though some politicians tout electric cars and trucks as a solution to California’s problems with air pollution, the state is struggling to get more of these vehicles on the road. Cost is at least partly to blame. Electric cars are specialty items: Mass-market brands like the $30,000 Nissan Leaf are still too expensive for most people, even with a federal tax credit and the state rebate. The state set an ambitious goal to put 5 million motorists in clean-air cars by 2030, but the number still hovers at 600,000 today. As policymakers offer incentives to low-income communities, they’re confronting another problem: the widespread perception that plug-in vehicles are only for affluent people. “Moderately priced, used vehicles actually aren’t a bad deal, but people get so nervous about them,” said Joel Levin, executive director of the nonprofit consumer group Plug In America. “If you don’t know anyone who drives an electric vehicle, then it’s harder to see yourself inside of one.” Working-class people tend to be the most dependent on automobiles, because many of them live in suburbs, rural areas, or inner-city pockets that aren’t well served by public transportation. Many also cut down their transportation spending by driving older, less fuel-efficient vehicles. Hernandez, for instance, clung to his ’96 Camry for six years, even though it burned too much oil, its motor and transmission were periodically breaking and it required major repairs just to pass smog checks. Eventually, even his mechanic advised that a new car would be more cost-effective. One day in April, Hernandez was watching the Spanish-language Telemundo channel when a public service announcement for the Clean Cars program caught his eye. “It was some kind of destiny,” he said. “I don’t usually watch the news in Spanish.” He quickly applied and bought the Ford C-Max in June from Rose Motors in Castro Valley. The car cost $16,000, and Hernandez’s monthly payments are $159 for 2½ years. But he saves significantly on gas, paying $25 every 11 days to fill the hybrid, instead of $40 every eight to 10 days for the Camry. And numerous reports show that the cost of maintaining electric vehicles tends to be lower than gas vehicles. For Hernandez and others, the grants have been transformative. Berkeley resident Sean Burns said he traded a dilapidated 2003 Mercedes-Benz for an electric 2016 Volkswagen e-Golf. The Air Quality Management District supplied $5,500 for the car and $2,000 to install a charger in his landlord’s driveway — Burns lives with his wife and kids in a backyard granny flat. He’d always had a sixth sense for finding deals on used cars — “I’d never bought anything that’s not at least 15 years old, and under $3,000,” Burns said — but with the rising urgency of climate change, he and his wife, Claire, thought that switching to an electric vehicle “was the right thing to do.” They bought the new car in late November. With the subsidy, it cost $9,000 after taxes. “It was the coolest car, and we just bought it outright,” Burns said. “We’re elated.” Rachel Swan is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

9,Berkeley considers banning the sale of gas-powered cars by 2027. But is it feasible?,"This is a carousel. Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate Berkeley is taking steps to ban the sale of gas-powered cars like these starting in 2027. An electric vehicle charging station at the Berkeley Marina. A mechanic at the McKevitt dealership in Berkeley works on a gas-powered car. Berkeley is considering banning the sale of cars powered by gasoline, diesel and natural gas by 2027 in a bid to combat climate change. The City Council is expected to direct the city manager on Jan. 19 to do a feasibility study before considering an ordinance that would phase out 80% of gasoline, diesel and natural gas passenger vehicle sales. The future ordinance would not apply to trucks. Berkeley would also stop purchasing these vehicles and convert its fleet of 129 vehicles to all electric. But not all Berkeley officials think the plan is feasible. Mayor Jesse Arreguín said he’s not sure that 2027 is a “realistic timeline” for banning gas-, natural gas- and diesel-powered vehicles, though he praised the effort to lead on climate change. It’s worth noting the ban would be confined to Berkeley’s city limits, which means consumers who want to purchase a gas-powered vehicle would just have to go to nearby Oakland. Some vehicle operators expressed skepticism about requiring car sales to go electric so soon. “I don’t think it’s feasible to think that you can actually end oil and gas,” said Jerry Griggs, the operations manager at Buggy Bank LLC, a display car service — a middleman between dealers and consumers — in Berkeley. “There are some pretty wackadoo things going on in politics right now. Those people are supposed to be smarter than us and they think it can happen, but I don’t see it.” The BMW dealership in Berkeley declined to comment. Toyota and Chrysler in Berkeley did not respond to a request for comment. The city’s efforts come afterGov. Gavin Newsom announced in September that Californiawill ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035. Newsom signed an executive order mandating that beginning in that year, new passenger vehicles sold must be zero-emission. Zero-emission vehicles include battery-powered electric cars and vehicles that run on hydrogen fuel cells. The California Air Resources Board will develop a plan that ensures new vehicles for sale will be mostly zero-emission leading up to 2035. Some Berkeley officials say 2035 is too late. “The transportation sector is the sector that we have tackled the least in some ways, and it is the biggest contributor to greenhouse gases that we have,” said Councilwoman Kate Harrison. The push from Harrison and other council members comes after former Councilwoman Cheryl Davila introduced the vehicle sales ordinance in December. That ordinance is on hold until city staff conduct the feasibility study. Davila did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Trump administration challenged California’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by banning the sale of gas-powered cars, calling it a job killer. But environmentalists hope the Biden administration will embrace California’s push. “Our hope is the Biden administration will come in ... and undo some of the damage Trump tried to do,” said Paul Cort, a staff attorney and director at Earthjustice. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association that represents GM and Fiat Chrysler, did not respond to a request for comment. Arreguín expressed concerns that auto dealerships are a “sizable portion” of the city’s tax base and how the ban would affect the city’s revenue streams. Harrison argued that the city would make up the lost revenue if current dealerships transition to selling electric vehicles. In addition, Arreguín said the city also needs to ensure certain streets are more accessible for people biking and using other forms of transportation. And any transition to electric must be equitable, he said. The city may look into imposing a tax on vehicle sales of over $30,000 to fund climate initiatives — a possibility that Arreguín said he is open to exploring. Berkeley’s ordinance would likely be applied to vehicles on a staggered timeline. Those valued at more than $28,000 would be phased out by 2025, more than $23,000 by 2026 and all others by 2027, according to a staff report. Berkeley has long paved the way for radical environmental policies. In 2019,Berkeley became the first city in the United Statesto ban the installation of natural gas lines in new homes.Many cities have since adopted similar bans. That same year, Berkeley banned single-use disposables, requiring restaurants to use compostable to-go packaging and utensils There is no timeline for when the council will vote on an ordinance to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles.

10,How electric cars can keep California’s power on without more natural gas,"When we’re not driving them, electric cars, trucks, and buses can act as “batteries on wheels.” Confronted with another bone-dry summer of wildfires and power shutoffs, California’s leaders have been working on a  plan to keep the lights on. After approving a state budget that allocated billions of taxpayer dollars to fossil fuel power plants, Gov. Newsom just called for an abrupt change in strategy. In a letter to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) — the agency leading the state’s climate plan — the governor instructed state regulators toavoidrelying on new gas plants and find cleaner ways to meet growing electricity demand. This is welcome news. Burning more gas when electricity supplies get tight will only create more deadly climate and air pollution. Instead, the governor should focus on unlocking the full potential of California’s one million solar roofs and one million electric vehicles to keep the lights on. When we’re not driving them, electric cars, trucks and buses can act as “batteries on wheels.” Emerging vehicle-grid integration technologies can be used to power homes and businesses by using the batteries in electric vehicles when the grid goes down. These mobile energy sources can also be moved where they’re needed most during power outages, like backing up medical centers, fire stations and food stores. California’s privately owned electric vehicle fleet already has a combined capacity larger than the potential five-gigawatt shortfall that has state officials scratching their heads. And that fleet and its battery capacity is growing rapidly. According to the California Public Utilities Commission, the state is expected to be home to 5 million electric vehicles by 2030. So far, in 2022 alone, 16% of all vehicles sold in California have been electric. The technology is there for these vehicles to become key assets in preventing power outages, but the policies are not — yet. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Tesla just announced a  program to use Tesla Powerwall batteries for emergency power when intense heat drives up demand on the grid this summer — a concept known as a virtual power plant. Participating battery owners will be paid for exporting power to the grid when energy supplies are limited during summer afternoons and evenings. This idea doesn’t need to be limited to PG&E customers who happen to own a Powerwall. Any owner of one of  California’s million (and counting) electric vehicles should be able to export power to the grid — and be rewarded for it — when demand is high. With the right policies in place, this kind of clean, distributed, and resilient energy system is within our reach. But despite investing heavily in the transition to climate-friendly transportation, state policymakers have not yet taken advantage of the opportunity to strengthen the reliability of the grid using electric vehicles. The state’s budget includes $10 billion for zero-emission vehicles, which could be used to enhance the resilience of California’s electricity system without furthering reliance on fossil fuels. For example, electric school buses that charge during the day — and hardly operate at all during the summer — could be deployed as a fleet of batteries on wheels in communities across California. California’s public agencies  own hundreds of thousands of vehicles. These agencies should be planning to not only continue electrifying their fleets, but also to use the battery storage available in these vehicles to prevent power outages in times of crisis. The state can’t achieve Gov. Newsom’s proposed transition away from natural gas on its own. Local government energy planning will also be key in maximizing the potential of California’s existing and future solar roofs and electric vehicles. A bill moving through the legislature,  the Community Energy Resilience Act (SB 833, Dodd),would help make this possible by providing funding and technical assistance to communities looking to build cleaner, more resilient energy systems. More local energy planning would also help to reduce demand on the grid, benefiting everyone. State leaders must also prioritize clean, distributed energy in underserved communities hit hardest by power outages and air pollution. These are the same communities where fossil-fueled power plants and generators are often located, even if they’re only used to keep power flowing to wealthier communities during peak summer months. Without investment in clean, distributed, resilient energy, California’s fossil fuel problem is  going to get worse. Not only does CARB have to find a way around polluting gas power plants, but purchases of toxic diesel generators have skyrocketed as home and business owners struggle with frequent power outages. Over the past three years, purchases of diesel generators jumped by34%in the Bay Area alone. Allowing this reliance on gas and diesel to continue — and even investing our tax dollars in it — would be a massive climate and public health failure. Gov. Newsom knows this, and he’s rightly taking action to prevent California from putting fossil fuels on life support. Now it’s time for the governor, legislators and agencies like CARB to begin building a grid for the future. With one million solar roofs and one million electric vehicles to start with, California has a huge opportunity to show what a clean, 21st-century power system could look like. Fossil fuels are our past. Clean, affordable, reliable, equitable and safe energy is our future.

12,Electric Vehicle Tax Break Extension Faces Stiff Challenges in a Cost-Conscious Legislature,"Consider the political oddity that is the electric vehicle sales tax exemption: Unless the Legislature acts this year, it expires July 1. A bipartisan group of legislators, known collectively as the electric vehicle caucus, has teamed up to extend it, which is something Gov. Jay Inslee is also pushing for.And yet, extending the exemption faces daunting legislative hurdles from two lawmakers whose politics couldn’t be further apart: Senate Majority Leader Mark Schoesler of Ritzville and House Finance Chairman Reuven Carlyle of Seattle.Schoesler said in a meeting with reporters Tuesday morning that the exemption will have to fit within the context of the state budget this year. Letting the tax preference sunset at the beginning of the fiscal year means the state can start banking the revenue it would have otherwise spent. The Department of Revenue,according to the Associated Press, estimated it costs about $13 million next year and $17 million in 2017, which depends on the number of electric vehicles sold.The tax break has been singled out by conservatives assimply a perk for the affluent,as the cars range in price from about $29,000 for a Nissan Leaf to $69,000 for a Tesla Model S, and even more for other models. Killing the tax exemption means more operating revenue for public schools or other budget needs.“We have to pause and wait and see on all of the tax exemptions,” Schoesler said. “Can we fit it in the budget box? How many jobs does it retain or create?”Carlyle also questioned the value of the tax incentive, and if the prospective electric car buyer would continue to make the purchase despite having to pay the sales tax on the car. He is aggressively targeting a wide swath of the state’s system of tax preferences.House Finance Chairman Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle, on the House floor.“The electric vehicle exemption is a policy that is put in place to try to move behavior,” Carlyle said in an interview. “It’s important that we make it work for the public. I am reluctant to embrace the proverbial winners and losers, which our current tax system does.”THE EV CAUCUSThe diverse group of lawmakers, started by Sen. Mark Mullet, D-Issaquah, last fall, includes Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon, D-Burien, Rep. Chad Magendanz, R-Issaquah, Sen. Andy Hill, R-Redmond, Rep. Ed Orcutt, R-Kalama, Rep. Dick Muri, R-Steilacoom, Rep. Jake Fey, D-Tacoma, Sen. John McCoy, D-Tulalip, and Sen. Pramila Jayapal, D-Seattle.Magendanz said he believes more widespread adaptation of electric vehicles would be an effective deterrent against the fact that cars and trucks contribute about half of the state’s total carbon emissions. Magendanz, who majored in electrical engineering in college, said he owns an electric BMW and an electric motorcycle.It’s not just carbon dioxide, Magendanz notes. Tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks also account for majority of the heavy particulate, such as the soot that results from diesel combustion.Rep. Chad Magendanz, R-Issaquah“From a market standpoint, we want to reduce those entry points as much as we can,” Magendanz said. “What we find with these tax incentives, they work. We want to kind of get that critical mass in the market to get the mass adoption.”It has drawbacks: A lack of charging stations in some areas of the state, and the fact that the battery charge makes it more suited for commuting than long distances. Gas prices have also plummeted in the last few months. An electric vehicle’s financial benefits will be a different proposition with gas at $2 a gallon than it was at $4, Magendanz notes.Yet, plug-in vehicle sales have grown on the national scale, from 17,735 total in 2011 to 118,773 in 2014, according to the Electric Drive Transportation Association. According to the association, two years ago the U.S. had about 70,000 battery electric vehicles and 104,000 plug in hybrids, which compares to an overall figure of 226 million registered cars nationwide.Californialeads the nation with about half of all plug-inslocated within its borders, but Washington is the only other state to have a per-capita adoption rate of more than 3 electric vehicles per 1,000 registered cars.Electric vehicle registration by county; map courtesy the Department of Transportation.Michael Mann, a lobbyist who represents Nissan in Olympia, said he doesn’t want to see lawmakers letting the sales tax exemption expire based on the drop in the price of gasoline.“The price of gas has gone down but I don’t think many people are going to believe it’s going to stay down for a long time,” Mann said. “You’re making a 7 to 10-year financial investment. Nissan has been a leader in electric vehicles in Washington state. This incentive is one of the reasons.”LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALSThere’s currently two competing bills that would extend the sales tax exemption beyond July. One, requested by the governor and co-sponsored by Sens. Marko Liias, D-Mukilteo, and Steve Litzow, R-Mercer Island, wouldcap the amount of sales tax exemption at $60,000 per car, and extend the tax break to 2025.Another bill, co-sponsored by Hill, Mullet, McCoy, Sen. Karen Keiser, D-Kent, Litzow and Jayapal, wouldput the cap at $45,000and extend the break through 2021.Any additional sales tax revenue generated beyond that would go to an infrastructure bank to install more charging stations along the public highway system. Inslee has his own measure to create the infrastructure bank.His proposal would be funded through his cap-and-trade program, which is up against stiff opposition in the Legislature this year. But Carlyle credited the governor with proposing a revenue source for the exemption. Carlyle wrote on his Facebook page in December that he wanted to see offsetting revenue for electric vehicles’ sales tax exemption, which would amount to about $60 million over four years.He said Tuesday that he isn’t a “hard no” on extending the exemption, but wants to see measurable results from the tax break. Both the Inslee proposal and the one sponsored by Mullet would require theJoint Legislative Audit and Review Committeereview the tax incentive to measure performance, which can be a mixed bag in terms of getting quantifiable data. The sales tax exemption has been in place since 2005, and electric vehicle sales have taken off in recent years through technological advancements.“I am not a ‘hard no’ on any of the proposals coming before the Legislature,” Carlyle said. “If it’s something that’s going to happen regardless of what the state does, I’ve got to be…questioning of the value. The governor’s job is to propose. Our job is to debate or dispose.”Magendanz said he appreciated the fiscally responsible approach Carlyle is taking, but doesn’t want to see the Legislature move to something that would be short-sighted.“Reuven’s taken it upon himself to be a bit more aggressive,” Magendanz said. “I respect what he’s doing. We’re up against some pretty big challenges to fund McCleary. We don’t want to make shortsighted decisions that would harm the state in the long run.”Your support matters.Public service journalism is important today as ever.

13,Op-ed: Now is the Time to Electrify Public Vehicle Fleets,"Matthew Metz is the founder and co-executive director ofColtura, a Seattle-based non-profit that is working to transition the country to zero-emission vehicles. He wrote the following op-ed in reference to Coltura’srecent reporton Washington State’s public fleet electric vehicle compliance.State and local governments in Washington own more than 30,000 vehicles. Roughly 99 percent of these vehicles run on gasoline or diesel, consuming more than 30 million gallons annually and contributing to the growing climate crisis. While much has been written about the benefits of transitioning away from harmful greenhouse gas-producing fossil fuels, many people do not realize that state law actually requires it.Effective June 1, 2018, state lawRCW 43.19.648, passed in 2007, requires that all state agencies and local government subdivisions must, “to the extent determined practicable… satisfy one hundred percent of their fuel usage for operating publicly owned vessels, vehicles, and construction equipment from electricity or biofuel.”So, how are we doing? Not well. New data published in “Recharge Required” shows most Washington public jurisdictions have not taken steps toward compliance or have only barely begun. The cities of Auburn, Federal Way, Kennewick, Kent, and Yakima have no electric vehicles (EVs) in their fleets. With the exception of Seattle, the 14 largest cities in the state only have between one and seven EVs in their respective fleets. Our counties are not doing any better. King County leads the way with nine EVs. Benton, Clark, Spokane, and Whatcom have no EVs in their fleets, and Kitsap, Pierce, Snohomish, Thurston and Yakima counties reported five or fewer EVs in their fleets. Even Seattle and King County, relative leaders in electrification, still buy far more gas and diesel vehicles than electrics.The Morning Wire: Keeping you informed on politics, policies, and personalities of Washington State.What’s worse, there’s been no enforcement of the law. Public vehicle purchases are usually made quietly and under the political radar. The State Department of Commerce, charged with overseeing compliance by hundreds of state agencies and local governments with the law, has only two people working on the issue. Furthermore, regulations promulgated by the Department do not effectively implement the law nor do they provide meaningful guidance to public entities seeking to comply. Only four of the 31 local governmental entities surveyed have an actionable plan for electrifying their fleet. Annual, legally-mandated reporting by state agencies and local governments to Commerce on progress implementing the fleet electrification law has not occurred.Besides offering numerous health and climate benefits, compliance with state law would yield significant cost savings and economic benefits. Every gallon of gas burned emits 20 pounds of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas that is the main driver of climate change. It is no wonder the transportation sector accounts for nearly half of all carbon dioxide pollution in the state, resulting in increased risks of asthma, heart and lung disease, dementia and cancers – especially in children and people living near busy roads.As for economic benefits, EVs have lower fuel and maintenance costs, as well as considerably lower annual operating costs and total costs of ownership. Electricity prices are more stable than gasoline and diesel prices, making budgeting for EVs much more accurate, and less subject to oil price shocks. Public fleet electrification would place Washington’s businesses, utilities, and governments on the leading edge of the EV revolution and help it remain competitive as the global trend towards vehicle electrification continues. Furthermore, as EV purchases increase, greater price reductions and technology improvements will occur for later buyers as EVs move through the experience curve and economies of scale are realized.While barriers to one hundred percent EV compliance still exist, EVs are practicable for much of our government fleets today. The state of Washington bought 125 all-electric Chevrolet Bolts for its fleet last year. King County Metro has purchased three electric buses, with plans to purchase 73 more by 2020, and to electrify its entire fleet by 2030. The City of Seattle has 175 EVs in its fleet, and recently opened a 156-unit EV charging facility in the municipal garage.Like all important changes to the status quo, the shift to electric fleets requires an engaged citizenry, civil servants dedicated to implementing the law, and vigilant oversight by elected officials. The law is already on the books and the technology is ready for deployment. It is time to embrace a clean future for our government fleets.Your support matters.Public service journalism is important today as ever.

14,Washington State passes law establishing 2030 target for phasing out gasoline vehicles,"The Washington State legislature has passed groundbreaking legislation that sets a target for all model year 2030 or later passenger and light-duty vehicles sold in Washington State to be electric vehicles. The new law establishes the most aggressive state goal in the U.S. for moving to an all-electric future and puts Washington five years ahead of California’s 2035 target.Clean Cars 2030passed as an amendment toE2SHB 1287, a bill mandating electric utility preparation for an all-EV future, with a vote of 25-23 in the Senate and 54-43 in the House. It now heads to Gov. Jay Inslee’s desk for signature.First introduced in the legislature by Rep. Nicole Macri (D-Seattle) as HB 1204, the bill is now the first gasoline phaseout target to be passed through the legislative process.The Morning Wire: Keeping you informed on politics, policies, and personalities of Washington State.“With the passage of Clean Cars 2030, the end of the era of gasoline-powered cars is in sight,” said Matthew Metz, co-executive director ofColtura. “Clean Cars 2030 sets Washington on a nation-leading path consistent with climate science and an auto industry trend toward a fully-electric automotive future. We applaud Rep. Macri, Rep. Alex Ramel (D-Bellingham), and Sen. Marko Liias (D-Lynnwood) for their leadership on this bill, as well as the many other legislators who made history with their votes.”Passage of this legislation takes the guesswork and uncertainty out of the electric vehicle transition by creating a clear timeline with the data, tools, and guidelines we need to help businesses, developers, governments, and consumers plan with confidence,” said Sen. Liias. “Clean Cars 2030 is a critical step to meet urgent carbon reduction goals here in Washington and can serve as a model and impetus for other states to accelerate the switch to EVs.”Since Clean Cars 2030 was introduced to the legislature on January 14, the automotive industry has accelerated the shift away from gasoline cars. GM announced plans to sell only zero-emissions vehicles by 2035, Ford said it would only sell EVs in Europe by 2030, BMW’s MINI sub-division pledged to be EV-only by 2030, and Volvo committed to selling only EVs by 2030.The 2030 target will be integrated into planning and financial decision-making by a broad group of government, automaker, utility, and other stakeholders. It will take full effect when 75 percent of vehicles on the road are subject to a road usage charge, a development which is expected within the next several years.Coltura spearheaded adiverse coalitionof more than 25 organizations advocating for the bill’s passage, including leading environmental, social justice, and faith groups across the state. The date certain established in the bill for the transition away from gasoline vehicles also attracted the support of the automotive and business community, including an endorsement from the Washington State Auto Dealers Association.This news release was provided byColturaYour support matters.Public service journalism is important today as ever.
