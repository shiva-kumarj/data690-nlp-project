Electric vehicle charging stations could be boost for small towns along Illinois highways,"
I have owned and driven an electric vehicle exclusively for almost two years. My experience says that while the electric charging station infrastructure in Chicago and the suburbs is okay, our state really falls down once you start driving south and west. Given that the majority of electric vehicle owners charge their vehicles at home, the real robust need for charging stations is away from major population centers.Along the state’s highways, there is great room for improvement. Lawmakers need to understand that installing a Level 3 charger draws someone to their community for longer than a quick fill-up. Electric vehicle owners often plan meals and shopping around their stops. This can be a business magnet for any community that installs the equipment.Don Anderson, Oak Park

Magical new worries about deficitIn a letter on Monday, a Sun-Times reader argued that President Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan is fiscally irresponsible. But the same reader has previous argued that President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cut was wonderful. That tax cut did not deliver the “four, five, six percent” growth that Trump had promised, but it did add $1 trillion a year to the federal deficit. So when a tax cut mostly benefits corporations and the wealthiest among us, there is no need to worry about the debt? But when there is an infrastructure plan that would benefit all of us, then the debt becomes all-important?  Kevin Coughlin, Evanston

"Pritzker signs electric vehicle legislation, aims to make Illinois a leader in ‘clean transportation revolution’","
Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday signed legislation aimed at drawing electric vehicle manufacturers to the state, a law he said will help Illinois usher in an era of “electric school buses, electric municipal buses, electric delivery trucks, electric 18-wheelers and so much more.”“With this new focus on electric vehicles, our state can also become a leader in the clean transportation revolution,” Pritzker said at the bill signing in Rockford Tuesday morning.The Reimagining Electric Vehicles in Illinois Act provides incentives for electric vehicle production across Illinois to help reach a 2030 goal of putting one million electric cars on the road.

The new law includes tax credits and exemptions for electric vehicle manufacturers and projects ranging from income tax withholding to credits for training costs and allowing local jurisdictions to ease property taxes for projects focused on electric-powered cars.The legislation also offers incentives for employers to locate their facilities in communities that have faced disinvestment historically. Pritzker said the act is intended to attract more electric vehicle makers, charging stations  and automotive parts manufacturers helping Illinois “become one of the leading [electric vehicle] hubs in the entire nation.”“Not only can we lead in the fight against climate change, we can also create thousands of jobs for hardworking Illinoisans in the process,” Pritzker said. “The Reimagining Electric Vehicles Act is about acknowledging that there doesn’t need to be a trade-off between a cleaner environment and more jobs. We can do both, and today we take a giant leap forward in that quest.”
During his trip overseas for the U.N.’s climate conference, Pritzker told the Chicago Sun-Times last week he had two goals: Tout the electric vehicle incentive legislation and meet with companies and business leaders in the industry to attract them to Illinois.Pritzker said the state’s location, workforce, transportation system — namely being a hub for major railroads — make Illinois “one of the most attractive in the country” for electric vehicle makers and the governor felt he and his team were “successful in planting seeds.”The law Pritzker signed Tuesday follows the Legislature’s passage of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act in September. That legislation, which overhauls the state’s energy sector, puts Illinois on a path to 100% clean energy by 2050 through a mix of providing subsidies to nuclear plants and setting closure timelines for coal and natural gas firing facilities among other things.

The subsidies include nearly $700 million over five years to Exelon nuclear plants. Municipal coal-burning plants — such as Prairie State and Springfield’s City Water, Light and Power — must cut their emissions by 45% by 2035 before closing 10 years later unless they can generate green hydrogen or use similar technology to get to zero carbon emissions.At the signing of the climate and jobs act, Pritzker said that law helps the state do everything it can “to fight, to stop, and even reverse, the damage that’s been done to our climate. “As of today, Illinois is a force for good, for an environmental future we can be proud of,” Pritzker said.

Illinois is sitting on millions that could be spent to promote electric cars and cleaner air,"
Illinois has an electric vehicle chicken-and-egg problem. More people and government agencies would use electric vehicles if there were more charging stations, and there would be a better argument for building more charging stations if more people and government agencies used electric vehicles.Fortunately, a big wad of cash is sitting largely untouched in a state fund that could be used to resolve the conundrum, and it would be perfectly appropriate to do so. The state should spend the funds to help jump-start its electric vehicle conversion agenda.

In 2016 and 2017, Illinois received $108 million from Volkswagen as part of a nationwide resolution of legal claims against the automaker, which had been caught secretly installing software on diesel cars to cheat the system and pass air quality tests. Of that money, $89 million still sits in the state’s Volkswagen Environmental Mitigation Trust fund.We can’t think of a better use for those funds than to speed up the state’s conversion to electric vehicles. Conventional trucks and cars have surpassed power plants as the prime source of the greenhouse gases that are overheating the planet.At the same time, given that the power for electric vehicles ultimately comes from power plants, Illinois must do more to convert to sources of renewable energy, such as wind and solar. The Volkswagen money sits largely unspent because the original plan for the fund, drawn up by the Rauner administration, emphasized the continued use of fossil fuels, such as replacing old diesel engines with newer ones. The plan should have been revised when Rauner left office, but it has not.We need a new plan now.The money from the Volkswagen trust could be coupled with about $70 million set aside for vehicle electrification in Illinois’ 2019 capital bill — money that also has been just sitting around. That money is earmarked for installing electric charging stations in low-income areas and electrifying public transit, but none of the funds has been spent in two years.

Additional money might also soon be available. The Clean Energy Jobs Act, which remains stalled in the Legislature, includes more than $700 million for transportation electrification, including public vehicles, school buses and charging infrastructure where the private sector has failed to provide it. President Joe Biden’s proposed $2 trillion infrastructure bill includes money for electric vehicle charging stations, retooling factories, credits for those who buy electric vehicles and electrifying the federal fleet. Time will tell how much of that funding comes through, but Gov. J.B. Pritzker — who says he wants to see 750,000 electric vehicles on Illinois roads by the year 2030 — has no reason to wait. By tapping those Volkswagen funds, he could do more right now to achieve that goal.Send letters to letters@suntimes.com.

Bring electric vehicle manufacturing to Illinois to help spark our economy,"
As some corporate headquarters decamp for other states, Gov. J.B. Pritzker needs to come through on his effort to make the state a center of electric vehicle manufacturing.Last week, freight car company TTX announced it is moving its headquarters to North Carolina. That follows headquarters departures last year by Boeing, Caterpillar, Citadel Securities and Highland Ventures. Also, Tyson Foods announced last year it would move jobs from Chicago to Arkansas. In decisions affecting fewer employees, other companies have moved in or out of Illinois or expanded or reduced their footprints.In Britain last week, Pritzker led a trade mission to ask companies that supply parts for electric vehicles to see Illinois as a good place to do business. The governor has said he wants to make Illinois a center of electric vehicle manufacturing, and he has been in talks to lure a major electric vehicle battery plant.

That would not only bring jobs to the state but also help Illinois meet Pritzker’s goal of 1 million electric vehicles on Illinois roads by 2030, as well as help offset revenue lost as other jobs have left the state.

In 2021, Lion Electric opened an electric bus manufacturing plant in Joliet. In 2019, Rivian Automotive moved into a former Mitsubishi plant in Normal to start building electric vehicles. But Illinois needs to build on those successes if it is to become an electric vehicle manufacturing center.

Where there’s smoke, fire up efforts to make air cleaner



To help get there, the Legislature in 2021 passed the Reimagining Energy and Vehicles in Illinois Act, which provides incentives to lure companies in the electric vehicle supply chain and promote renewable energy. Another law passed last year will require new or renovated homes to have conduits to charge electric vehicles.Moreover, the federal Inflation Reduction Act and the National Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provide incentives for electric vehicles, and in January, Pritzker signed a bill setting out requirements for electric vehicle parking spaces.
But Illinois ought to do more to boost the market for electric vehicles. In its latest budget, the state trimmed about $7.3 million from its electric vehicle rebate program, cutting it to about $12 million. In the previous year, $19.3 million was available for the rebates, which give $4,000 to customers who buy new or used EVs from licensed dealers. Demand was so high, the program ran out of money about halfway through the fiscal year.More money should be made available for rebates, though perhaps better targeted, to avoid them going to people buying top-end models who could afford to buy electric cars without rebates.Illinois also should adopt the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, to phase out most gasoline-powered heavy-duty trucks and step up the efforts to get more electricity-powered vehicles on the roads.It also should raise emission standards, as some other states have done, including Minnesota in the Midwest, which would have the effect of requiring national auto manufacturers to sell a higher percentage of electric vehicles in Illinois, helping to create a bigger market here.

Manufacturing electric vehicles is a growth market. Nationally, EV sales are on a pace to top 1 million this year, a milestone, and sales were up in the second quarter by 50% over the same time last year, although there are signs that demand is not keeping up with production as fewer models qualify for federal tax credits.Seeing corporate jobs leaving Illinois is not a good trend. But the nation’s major auto manufacturers are committed to building more electric vehicles, and Pritzker can help offset the loss of corporate jobs if he succeeds in bringing a healthy chunk of those electric vehicle jobs to Illinois.The Sun-Times welcomes letters to the editor and op-eds. See our guidelines.Send letters to letters@suntimes.com.
