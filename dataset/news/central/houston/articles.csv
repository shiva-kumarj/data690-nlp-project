How electric vehicles can help cities like Houston fight climate change,"Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner was one ofmore than 300 mayorswho departed from President Donald Trump's decision to exit the Paris climate agreement. And this departure reaffirmed what was already clear: The federal government is no longer leading American efforts to shrink our carbon footprint. In fact, Houston is just one of many local and state governments –along with businessesand consumers– aiming to help fill this policy void. At least a dozen governors have joined theUnited States Climate Alliance, committing their states to achieve emissions reductions consistent with President Barack Obama’s Paris pledge. My researchwith my former studentShayak Senguptaabout how cities like Houston can benefit from buying electric cars suggests that fuel-free municipal fleets can cut urban carbon footprints while improvingpublic healthand saving taxpayers money. Here's a map of the 12 states, 1 territory and 211 cities committed to the Paris Agreement targets (as of 5pm EDT). 125 million people.pic.twitter.com/YfRexyWvbi  Options for states and cities States can help curb emissions in many ways, such as bysetting capson power plant emissions andcreating incentives and targetsfor renewable electricity. Most of those steps lies beyond the jurisdiction of cities. So how can they take climate action? Urban governments most strongly impact emissions byinfluencing the behaviorof local residents and businesses through building codes and incentives, public transit and urban planning. Buyingincreasingly affordableelectric vehicles gives cities an additional opportunity to cutclimate-warming emissionsby reducing the amount of fossil fuels their vehicles consume. Historically, cities and transit agencies turned tonatural gasas an alternative fuel for fleet vehicles and buses. However, ourprevious researchshowed that natural gas does not provide significant emissions savings compared with gasoline cars or diesel buses. Electric vehicles, however, can bring about clear-cut reductions in carbon emissions.  The electric vehicle market U.S. cities own few of the540,000 electric carson the road nationwide as of 2016. The nation’s two largest cities,New York CityandLos Angeles, operate 1,000 and 200 electric cars, respectively. That could soon change. Thirty cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston,are seeking bulk-rate dealson electric vehicles. They’ve asked manufacturers to submit bids to supply up to 114,000 electric vehicles, ranging from police cruisers to trash haulers, at a totalcost of roughly $10 billion. This surge in electric vehicle sales could make them more affordable — not just for cities but for the rest of us, too. That’s because emerging technologies typically get cheaper as production increases. A study by researchers from theStockholm Environment Instituteestimates that electric car batteries prices fall by 6 percent to 9 percentevery time production doubles. Someanalystsforecastthat as soon as 2025, electric cars will become cheaper than gasoline-powered cars. In some cases, they are already cheaper to own and operate over the vehicle’s lifetime,our researchhas shown. If cities help ramp up demand for electric cars faster than anticipated, this transition could happen even faster.  Municipal fleets City-owned fleets are in some ways ideal candidates for electric-powered transportation. Cities operate large numbers of vehicles in densely populated areas, where emissions most endangerhuman health. Local driving by municipal employees is well-suited for electric cars. For example, the Nissan Leaf now has a range of as much as107 miles, and the Chevy Bolt can travel238 mileswithout recharging. Meanwhile, electric models of pickup trucks, dump trucks, buses and police cruisers are becomingincreasingly available.  Houston's vehicles We studiedvehicle options available  to Houston, whichoperates a fleetof about 12,000 vehicles, in 2015. Those options included two gasoline-powered Toyota sedans (the Corolla and the Prius), the natural gas-powered Honda Civic, the plug-in hybrid Toyota Prius and the fully electric Nissan Leaf. Since all these sedans seat five passengers, they are interchangeable. Because Houston in 2015 bought 75 percent of its electricity from wind farms (it now drawseven more of its power from wind and solarsources),we calculatedthat the fully electric Leaf would have reduced life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 87 percent relative to the gasoline-powered Corolla over seven years. About half of those benefits would have been lost if the Leaf was charged from the fossil-heavy gridelsewhere in Texas. Financially, the savings on fuel and maintenance would have more than offset the $12,000 premium for buying a Leaf instead of a Corolla. We estimated that Houston would have saved about $.0.04 per mile while operating the Leafs, as long as enough charging stations were available. That’s even before counting any savings from bulk purchases orfederal tax credits. Now that the City has negotiated itsnew solar deal, it'sleading all cities in renewable power purchasesand getting 89 percent of its power from renewables. So, electric vehicles today would cut emissions even more than at the time of our study.  Charging stations One significant problem holding back demand for electric vehicles is the shortage of charging stations. Greater availability of charging stations assures cities and consumers that full electrics like the Nissan Leaf can complete their trips, and lets plug-in hybrids like the Chevy Volt operate mostly in electric mode. That’s whycities like Pittsburghhave obtained state grants to build their own, whileutilities in SeattleandKansas Cityare building charging stations to jump-start demand for electric cars. Electric municipal fleets won’t by themselves propel cities all the way to their Paris-based pledges. But by speeding the adoption of charging stations and cleaner cars, they could help curb emissions – while saving money for urban taxpayers and improving public health.

Opinion: Electric vehicles are no silver bullet,"Regarding ""Tomlinson: GM’s new Hummer and other EVs pose challenge to Elon Musk and Texas's oil industry,"" (Jan. 16): Tomlinson breezily dismisses any stress on the Texas grid that an increase in EVs would create by stating that people would charge their cars at night. However, this is precisely when energy derived from both wind and solar can be at their lowest. Clearly, solar energy is at a minimum when the sun goes down but so can wind. Wind speed over landtends to decrease during the nightwhen the ground is not heated by the sun. Grid storage batteries deplete in two to four hours depending on power usage and the cost can be prohibitive. One popular grid storage battery, the Tesla Megapack, costs$691,369.23 per megawatt hour. Furthermore, Gillingham and others at Yale document that, using today’s prices for coal and hydrocarbons, widespread adoption of electric carsmay actually increase CO2 emissions. They note that for EVs to have a positive effect on CO2 emissions, it would require large increases in the cost of fossil fuel energy in the form of carbon taxes. This wouldlikely greatly affect the nation’s poorand make our products far less competitive in global markets. That would work to the great benefit of China, where51.7 percentof the world's coal is burned and where they are currently building33 gigawatts of coal-based power generation, three times more than the rest of the world combined. Jory A. Pacht, Houston Here he goes again. Chris Tomlinson's column once again extols the virtues of EVs, and how they will replace the internal combustion engine. Maybe I did not read clearly enough, however I did not read where he states how long it takes to charge an electric vehicle. Other reading in the Wall Street Journal tells meit takes 20 minutes or more to recharge, on average, with a high-powered DC fast charger. Imagine waiting 30 minutes to recharge your EV when it is 95 degrees outside with 90 percent humidity in Houston. Sounds like great fun! And you'll get 300 miles — whoopee! Many of us drive that in one day. What about the price? I have also readEVs cost, on average, $66,000. That seems affordable to those households making over $200,000 per year, which is6.7 percent of American consumers. Sounds very affordable to so many, correct? Oh, and lastly, Tomlinson states that the vehicles may be charged at night. I see videos online of thosevehicles exploding in flames, and I don’t think they are photoshopped. I still can’t wait until I get mine! Tom Miltenberger, Missouri City In 2020, some276 million vehicleswere registered in the United States. As of 2020, there areover a million EVson U.S. roads. They all need charging stations that should be powered by fossil fuels, some wind and solar with some nuclear energy mixed in. Factor in the EVs that are made and used by Peterbuilt, Mack, Union Pacific, Boeing, Air Force One, the military (such as the M1 Abrams gas turbine main battle tank), container ships coming to the port of Houston, so on. Are we kidding ourselves? We will need that gas, diesel and Jet A fuel for a long time. George Gould, LaMarque Regarding ""Wind and solar boom set to go into high gear,"" (Dec. 30): With more use of clean energy being the bandwagon of the moment, the growing use of solar farms in Texas is a concern to me. We love the touted open spaces yet we cheer the growth of solar farms, which encroach on the open spaces. Why not use all the roofs of urban area buildings for these farms? Are we missing an opportunity? John Kolodczak, Newark, Del. (with Texas roots in Plantersville) Regarding ""Economic woes, war, climate change on tap for Davos meeting,"" (Jan. 16): I was watching the recent World Economic Forum, and was astounded by the hypocrisy that abounds. There were 2,000 plus participants,half of which arrived in private jetsbut espoused saving the environment with their green energy proposals. Then they want to keep everyone from eating meat, but have huge plates of beef and other meats served atexpensive dinners. Could these people be any more hypocritical? The world would be better served if they gave their money to those countries in need, rather than working towards restricting them from using the fossil fuels they need for their betterment. Maybe those at the WEF are naive, but I think that they all have an ulterior motive. Look at the companies that both Al Gore and John Kerry benefit from. They have become uber-rich from their ecological proselytizing. And yes, they do fly around in some really nice private jets. But I guess that is OK so long as you talk the good talk.

"Nearly half of U.S. car buyers plan to go electric in next two years, report finds","Analysts at Ernst and Young surveyed 1,500 U.S. consumers in March and found that 48 percent of vehicle buyers plan to purchase an EV – representing a nearly 20 percent jump from last year’s survey. Nearly half of U.S. consumers who plan to buy a car in the next two years say they’ll go electric, according to a new report from consulting firm Ernst and Young. Analysts atErnst and Young surveyed 1,500 U.S. consumersin March and found that 48 percent of vehicle buyers plan to purchase an EV – representing a nearly 20 percent jump from last year’s survey. Texas is already one of the fastest growing states for EV adoption, recently hitting200,000 electric vehicle registrations in the state, according to an analysis from Dallas-Fort Worth Clean Cities. Houston drivers account for nearly a quarter of EV registrations in the states. EV ROAD TRIPS:See how Tesla and other popular models perform on a Texas road trip Despite enthusiasm for EVs among buyers, concerns about access to charging stations persists. Just over half of U.S. consumers surveyed by Ernst and Young said they were concerned about finding charging stations. “Consumers need access to safe, reliable, convenient and affordable charging to drive and own an EV, and our research shows real concerns remain,” Marc Coltelli, Americas leader of electric mobility at Ernst and Young, said in a statement. “To scale adoption, the challenge confronting America’s transition to EVs is instilling charging confidence among consumers.” In the recent Texas legislative session, lawmakers passed two measures,Senate Bills 1001 and 1002, aimed at increasing charging stations in the state. Already charging stations have been popping up at major grocery stores and gas stations. MORE ON EVs:The Houston Chronicle’s EV Buyer’s Guide Moving away from gasoline powered cars to electric vehicles is a major pillar in fighting climate change. Around28 percent of  greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. come from transportation, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. But electricity experts say upgrades must be made to the power grid so it can support the additional use. University of Houston Energy Fellow Ed Hirs said for the moment the Texas grid can handle the number of EVs on the road, but if the rate of EV adoption continues to increase – which Hirs said he expects – then it will change the characteristics of electricity demand on the grid. “We ordinarily see demand fall off during the evening hours,” Hirs said. “I’m expecting that over time we will see the demand begin to (rise) incrementally at night due to the addition of home charging.” Hirs said more utility scale batteries, which are currently negligible butgrowing rapidly in Texas, will likely help balance that demand.
