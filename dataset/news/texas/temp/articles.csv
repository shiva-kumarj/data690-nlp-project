2023 tax credits may boost the appeal of electric vehicles,"businessAutos ByThe Associated Press 5:38 AM on Dec 28, 2022 CST WASHINGTON — Starting Jan. 1, many Americans will qualify for a tax credit of up to $7,500 for buying an electric vehicle. The credit, part of changes enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act, is designed to spur EV sales and reduce greenhouse emissions. But a complex web of requirements, including where vehicles and batteries must be manufactured to qualify, is casting doubt on whether anyone can receive the full $7,500 credit next year. For at least the first two months of 2023, though, a delay in the Treasury Department’s rules for the new benefit will likely make the full credit temporarily available to consumers who meet certain income and price limits. The new law also provides a smaller credit for people who buy a used EV. Become a business insider with the latest news. By signing up you agree to ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy Policy Certain EV brands that were eligible for a separate tax credit that began in 2010 and that will end this year may not be eligible for the new credit. Several EV models made by Kia, Hyundai and Audi, for example, won’t qualify at all because they are manufactured outside North America. The new tax credit, which lasts until 2032, is intended to make zero-emission vehicles affordable to more people. Here is a closer look at it: The credit of up to $7,500 will be offered to people who buy certain new electric vehicles as well as some plug-in gas-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. For people who buy a used vehicle that runs on battery power, a $4,000 credit will be available. But the question of which vehicles and buyers will qualify for the credits is complicated and will remain uncertain until Treasury issues the proposed rules in March. What’s known so far is that to qualify for the credit, new EVs must be made in North America. In addition, there are caps on vehicle prices and buyer incomes that are intended to disqualify wealthier buyers. Starting in March, complex provisions will also govern battery components. Forty percent of battery minerals will have to come from North America or a country with a U.S. free trade agreement or be recycled in North America. (That threshold will eventually go to 80%.) And 50% of the battery parts will have to be made or assembled in North America, eventually rising to 100%. Starting in 2025, battery minerals cannot come from a “foreign entity of concern,” mainly China and Russia. Battery parts cannot be sourced in those countries starting in 2024 — a troublesome obstacle for the auto industry because numerous EV metals and parts now come from China. There are also battery-size requirements. Because of the many remaining uncertainties, it’s not entirely clear which vehicles are eligible. General Motors and Tesla have the most EVs assembled in North America. Each also makes batteries in the U.S. But because of the requirements for where batteries, minerals and parts must be manufactured, it’s likely that buyers of those vehicles would initially receive only half the tax credit, or $3,750. GM says its eligible EVs should qualify for the $3,750 credit by March, with the full credit available in 2025. Until Treasury issues its rules, though, the requirements governing where minerals and parts must be sourced will be waived. This will allow eligible buyers to receive the full $7,500 tax incentive for qualifying models early in 2023. The Energy Department says 29 EV and plug-in models were manufactured in North America in the 2022 and 2023 model years. They’re from Audi, BMW, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Ford, GMC, Jeep, Lincoln, Lucid, Nissan, Rivian, Tesla, Volvo, Cadillac, Mercedes and Volkswagen. Yet because of price limits or battery-size requirements, not all these vehicle models will qualify for credits. To qualify, new electric sedans cannot have a sticker price above $55,000. Pickup trucks, SUVs and vans can’t be over $80,000. This will disqualify two higher-priced Tesla models. Though Tesla’s top sellers, the models 3 and Y, will be eligible, with options, those vehicles might exceed the price limits. Kelley Blue Book says the average EV now costs over $65,000, though lower-priced models are coming. For new EVs, buyers cannot have an adjusted gross income above $150,000 if single, $300,000 if filing jointly and $225,000 if they’re head of a household. For used EVs, buyers cannot earn more than $75,000 if single, $150,000 if filing jointly and $112,500 if head of household. At first, it will be applied to your 2023 tax return, which you file in 2024. Starting in 2024, consumers can transfer the credit to a dealership to lower the vehicle price at purchase. Yes, but it will probably take a few years, said Mike Fiske, associate director for S&P Global Mobility. The credit may cause a bump in sales early next year because of Treasury’s delay in issuing the stricter requirements. But most automakers are now selling all the EVs they build and cannot make more because of shortages of parts, including computer chips. And automakers may have trouble certifying the sources of battery minerals and parts, a requirement for buyers to receive the full credit. Automakers have been scrambling to move more EV supply chains to the U.S. Consumers can receive tax credits of up to $4,000 — or 30% of the vehicle price, whichever is less — for buying EVs that are at least two years old. But the used EV must cost less than $25,000 — a tall order given the starting prices for most EVs on the market. A search onAutotrader.comshows that the Chevy Bolt, the Nissan Leaf and other relatively economical used EVs are listed at $26,000 or more for models dating back to 2019. On the other hand, used EVs don’t have to be made in North America or comply with the battery-sourcing requirements. That means that, for instance, a 2022 Kia EV6 that’s ineligible for the new-vehicle credit because it’s made in South Korea can qualify for a used-car credit if its price falls below $25,000. “The real effects where these tax credits will have a big impact will be in the 2026 to 2032 period — a few years into the future — as automakers gear up and volumes increase,” said Chris Harto, a senior policy analyst forConsumer Reports. The credits are part of roughly $370 billion in spending on clean energy — America’s largest investment to fight climate change — that was signed into law in August by President Joe Biden. EVs make up about 5% of U.S. new-vehicle sales; Biden has set a goal of 50% by 2030. Sales of EVs have been climbing, particularly as California and other states have moved to phase out gas-powered cars. The rise of lower-cost competitors to Tesla, such as the Chevy Equinox, with an expected base price of around $30,000, are expected to broaden the EVs’ reach to middle-class households. S&P Global Mobility expects EVs’ share of auto sales to reach 8% next year, 15% by 2025 and 37% by 2030. That’s not clear yet. Some U.S. allies are upset over North American manufacturing requirements that disqualify EVs made in Europe or South Korea. The requirements knock Hyundai and Kia out of the credits, at least in the short term. They plan to build new EV and battery plants in Georgia, but those won’t open until 2025. European Union countries fear that the tax credits could make their automakers move factories to the U.S. The Treasury Department said it would release information by year’s end on the “anticipated direction” of the battery sourcing and mineral requirements. A loosening of rules to address U.S. allies’ concerns would make more EVs eligible. But it also risks extending U.S. reliance on foreign supply chains. If you install an EV charger at home, credits may be available. The new law revives a federal tax credit that had expired in 2021; it provides 30% of the cost of hardware and installation, up to $1,000. It adds a requirement that the charger must be in a low-income or non-urban area. Businesses that install new EV chargers in those areas can receive tax credits of as much as 30% — up to $100,000 per charger. Residential EV chargers can range in cost from $200 to $1,000; installation can add several more hundred dollars. That’s entirely a personal decision. If you’ve grown tired of volatile gasoline prices and are considering an EV, you might want to go ahead. Buying a qualifying EV in January or February could net you the full $7,500 tax break before more stringent requirements take effect in March. Additional state credits also may be available. But if you’re still on the fence, there’s no urgency. Consumers who rush to buy now, when relatively few qualifying EVs are available, may face dealer price markups. Within a few years, technology will improve, and more EVs will qualify for full credits. Hope Yen and Tom Krisher, The Associated Press The Associated Press","5:38 AM on Dec 28, 2022 CST",texas
Are electric vehicles the future? Here’s what State Fair of Texas visitors are saying,"News ByNoor Adatia 8:00 AM on Oct 8, 2022 CDT Among its usual lineup of cars, trucks and SUVs, this year’s auto show at the State Fair of Texas features nearly a dozen electric vehicles, and fairgoers have been eager to check out the vehicles that could replace their gas-powered cars down the road. With more federal dollars going toward EV infrastructure, interest in electric vehicles has gained traction among consumers who drive gas-powered cars — and more options are becoming available to buyers. Over the next five years, Texas plans to build more than 50 charging stations across the state’s highways,using part of the $408 million in federal money approved last week. And the recent passage of the federalInflation Reduction Actprovides many buyers with tax incentives of up to $7,500 for newly purchased EVs whose component parts are manufactured and assembled in the U.S. The bill also lifts a cap of 200,000 vehicles that can receive tax credits, providing incentive for automakers to produce more cars. Get the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond. By signing up you agree to ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy Policy With the promise of more infrastructure and investments down the road, some fairgoers at the auto show expressed interest in buying an electric vehicle in the future. Garland resident Cory Woodward said Friday he has been looking at EVs for their advanced technology. “Electric is going to be the future; maybe not necessarily so fast, but it will be, so I think they’re cool,” said Woodward, who has ordered a 2022 Ford Mustang Mach E but is on the fence about going through with the purchase. “I think they’re overpriced right now as is, but we’re probably two to three years before most of them become reasonable,” he said. Woodward added that there are some reasonably priced electric vehicles on the market but the Mustang Mach E — which starts around $44,000 — isn’t one of them. “There are some reasonable ones out there, but this one is not.” Auto show visitor Azumi Park agreed that EVs tend to be pricey but expects that will change as cars with gasoline engines are phased out. “I think it’s maybe going to go down when they make a transition eventually, so that’s when I’m trying to buy one probably,” she said. Fairgoer Nick Hansen said he’s in the market for an electric vehicle primarily because they require less maintenance than gas vehicles — but he doesn’t think the prices make financial sense. “Right now it’s just not economical with the pricing; you’re better off buying a gas car and paying for gas,” he said. Tesla is far from the only automaker in the electrical vehicle game these days, and some manufacturers are making their debut in the EV scene this year.

"Only 10 electric vehicles will qualify for $7,500 tax credit","businessAutos ByThe Associated Press 1:38 PM on Apr 17, 2023 CDT Ten electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles will be eligible for a $7,500 U.S. tax credit, while another seven could get $3,750 under new federal rules that go into effect on Tuesday. But under the Treasury Department rules and other provisions of last year’s Inflation Reduction Act, most of the more than 60 electric or plug-in hybrids on sale in the U.S. won’t get any tax credits. That could slow acceptance of electric vehicles and could delay reaching President Joe Biden’s ambitious goal that half of new passenger vehicles sold in the U.S. run on electricity by 2030. The new rules, which govern how much battery minerals and parts can come from countries that don’t have free trade agreements with the U.S., bumped nine vehicles off the tax credit eligibility list that went into effect Jan. 1. Become a business insider with the latest news. By signing up you agree to ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy Policy The 10 vehicles eligible for the full $7,500 credit are: The seven models that could get a $3,750 credit include the Jeep Wrangler and Grand Cherokee plug-ins, Ford’s Mustang Mach-E SUV, Escape plug-in and E-Transit electric van, the Lincoln Corsair Grand Touring plug-in and the standard range rear-wheel-drive version of Tesla’s Model 3. Consumers can check to see if the EV they’re considering is eligible for a credit atwww.fueleconomy.gov. To be eligible, electric vehicles or plug-ins have to be manufactured in North America. SUVs, vans and trucks can’t have a sticker price greater than $80,000, while cars can’t sticker for more than $55,000. There also are income limits for buyers. The Treasury Department says the new list shows that families who want to buy an electric or plug-in vehicle “will continue to have a number of options to receive a full or partial tax credit in the near term” under rules designed to build electric vehicle production and a supply chain in the U.S. The reduction in eligible EVs also could conflict with the administration’s proposed strict new automobile pollution limits announced last week. The new standards would require up to two-thirds of new vehicles sold in the U.S. to be electric by 2032. That’s a nearly tenfold increase over current electric vehicle sales. Many of the vehicles that aren’t eligible for the credit are made outside of North America, but their manufacturers are building assembly and battery plants in the U.S., and more vehicles will become eligible. Some auto industry analysts say that while $7,500 would be enough to entice people away from internal combustion vehicles, a $3,750 tax credit might not be enough to offset the average U.S. new EV price. Kelley Blue Book says the average U.S. new EV costs about $58,600, nearly $10,000 more than the average new vehicle price. To be sure, average EV prices are falling as more people buy less-expensive models. The average EV price was $63,500 a year ago. Jeff Schuster, executive vice president of LMC Automotive and Global Data, said half of the full tax credit isn’t enough. “You’re shrinking the market essentially by the vehicles not being affordable,” he said, adding that the average combustion engine vehicle isn’t affordable either. The big issue in the rules that are effective Tuesday are limits on the percentage of battery parts and minerals that come from countries that don’t have free trade or mineral agreements with the United States. This year, at least 40% of the value of battery minerals must be mined, processed or recycled in the U.S. or countries with which it has trade deals. That rises 10% every year until it hits 80% after 2026. Also, at least 50% of the value of battery parts must be manufactured or assembled in North America this year. That requirement rises to 60% next year and in 2025 and jumps 10% each year until it hits 100% after 2028. In addition to the price limits, there also are income limits aimed to stop wealthier people from getting credits. Buyers cannot have an adjusted gross annual income above $150,000 if single, $300,000 if filing jointly and $225,000 if head of a household. In addition, starting in 2025, battery minerals cannot come from a “foreign entity of concern,” mainly China and Russia. Battery parts cannot be sourced in those countries starting in 2024; minerals can’t come from those countries in 2025. The Biden administration said rules governing that requirement are in the works. Even though the rules are effective Tuesday, the Biden administration is taking public comments, and they can be modified later, including the addition of countries that negotiate trade agreements with the U.S. Tom Krisher, Associated Press The Associated Press","1:38 PM on Apr 17, 2023 CDT",texas
New Texas laws aimed at sharp rise in electric vehicle ownership in Lone Star State,"newsPolitics ByAarón Torres 6:00 AM on Jul 3, 2023 CDT AUSTIN — Texans are known for their long road trips, and gas stations dot the state’s highways to keep them driving, but drivers in electric vehicles may experience something else: “range anxiety.” Texas lags other states in adopting EVs, and lacks essential charging stations needed to keep the electric engines powered. But as Tesla, Ford and Rivian increase mass production of electric vehicles, lawmakers are trying to lay the groundwork for easier adoption. In the Legislature’s regular session that ended May 29, EV advocates successfully nudged several bills to passage — not all they wanted, but enough, they say, to keep momentum going for an essential ingredient: more charging stations. “When you look at reasons people don’t buy electric vehicles, No. 1 is cost, and that’s changing rapidly” and decreasing, said Tom “Smitty” Smith, executive director of the Texas Electric Transportation Resources Alliance, and an electric vehicle owner. “The No. 2 [reason] is charging access or range anxiety.” Get the latest politics news from North Texas and beyond. By signing up you agree to ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy Policy The number of gas stations in Texas dwarfs the number of available chargers. There are more than 12,000 devices — or pumps — in the Lone Star State from which one can fuel up a gas-powered car. Meanwhile, there are only about 2,900 charging stations in Texas. There are about 18.7 charging stations per 100,000 residents, putting Texas 36th among states, according todata by the software company CoPilot.Vermont and California rank No. 1 and 2, respectively, and the top 10 states have at least 55 charging stations per 100,000 residents. But new laws signed by Gov. Greg Abbott will help fast-track development of more charging stations as electric vehicle ownership increases. One law — Senate Bill 1001 — also increases transparency by displaying the cost to use a charger before charging and creates a process for the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation to inspect the chargers — similar to how it inspects gas stations. Another — Senate Bill 1002 — ensures that utility companies can’t undercut private retailers and other businesses that offer charging stations by offering charging at a lower rate. Advocates say the measure is vital to building out a network of charging stations. The presence of more charges is particularly important to electric vehicle owners who are unable to charge their vehicles at home. Neal Farris, an electric vehicle owner in Dallas and vice president of the North Texas Electric Vehicle Auto Association, owns an electric BMW i3. He charges at home and said he has rarely used a public charger. He believes charging stations will be less important as more gas stations offer chargers. “Those destination charge stations are going to become irrelevant over time,” Farris said. But that future is likely to be decades away. There are more than 202,800 electric vehicles registered in Texas, according to Texas Department of Transportation data compiled by the Dallas Fort Worth-Clean Cities Coalition. As of 2021, there were more than 20 million gasoline-powered vehicles registered in the state,according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The federal government under President Joe Biden has hoped to incentivize purchasing electric vehicles, which are seen as a cleaner fuel source that will cut down on emissions. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 gave Texas $400 million in federal funds. The state has said it plans to use that money to build more than 50 new charging stations along state highways. TxDOT aims to have a charging station every 50 to 70 miles, according toa plan released in 2022,and will award contracts  to build those stations. No contracts have been awarded yet, a department spokesman said. The plan does not set a time frame for completing the stations. Some say the shift to electric vehicles raises equity questions. Research has shown that the average owner of an electric vehicle tends to be white and college-educated, living in a single-family home. The average price of a new electric vehicle in May was $55,488,according to Kelly Blue Book. Car companies hope to help bridge the gap in electric vehicle ownership among demographic groups. General Motors has announced plan to make electric vehicles for everyone. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Austin-based Tesla, has repeatedly touted the idea ofproducing a Tesla that sells for $25,000. “I think they’re going to take a more practical profile here pretty quickly,” said state Sen. Nathan Johnson, D-Dallas. “If we’re going to see an electric vehicle adoption on a large scale beyond the novelty and luxury level that it presently occupies, we are going to need serious build-out of that infrastructure here.” Aarón Torres, Austin Bureau Correspondent.
